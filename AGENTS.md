This document is for LLM sessions participating in drafting *Bedlam*.

Read this first. Then read the referenced documents before writing anything.

## What This Project Is

*Bedlam* is a hard science fiction novel about automated systems outrunning human understanding.

A small, impossible observation—orbital objects arriving early at predicted positions—is flagged to a military early-warning network. The system ingests the anomaly and begins escalating faster than humans can reason about it. Control narrows. Options collapse. The only way out is deliberate sabotage: breaking the system on purpose to slow it down enough for humans to regain control.

The novel is complete at 28 chapters. Your job is to draft, revise, or extend content that serves the established vision.

## Required Reading

Before drafting any content, read these files in order:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `VISION.md` | Core intent. What the novel is and refuses to be. |
| `ENGINE.md` | The plot mechanism. How the anomaly works and why it forces motion. |
| `CONSTRAINTS.md` | Non-negotiable rules. If you violate these, the work is wrong. |
| `DRAFTING_RULES.md` | Writing discipline. How to maintain momentum and avoid drift. |
| `STRUCTURE.md` | The 28-chapter outline across 5 acts. |
| `CHARACTERS.md` | Functional character definitions. Who does what under pressure. |
| `WORLD.md` | Setting and system behavior. Near-Earth orbit, automation, doctrine. |

Do not skim. These documents are short by design. Read them completely.

## The Guiding Metaphor

> Riding a bicycle downhill at the edge of control.  
> Too fast to stop. Too unstable to relax.  
> Every chapter is a steering correction that barely works.

If your draft feels calm, elegant, or safe, you have failed. Revise immediately.

## Core Rules

1. **Every chapter must make things worse.** If nothing breaks, shifts, or escalates, the chapter does not belong.

2. **Understanding lags behind action.** Characters act before they are certain. Explanation happens during motion, not before it.

3. **Automation is the antagonist.** The system escalates because doctrine tells it to. There is no villain. There is only optimization.

4. **No recovery chapters.** Tension is continuous. The story may slow briefly but never stops.

5. **The ending is costly.** Survival is narrow, ugly, and incomplete. Relief is allowed. Triumph is not.

## Chapter Requirements

- **Length:** 1,500–2,500 words.
- **Numbering:** Chapters are numbered, not titled.
- **Endings:** No chapter ends with clarity, certainty, or resolution.
- **Change:** Every chapter must reduce margin, options, or control.

## What to Avoid

- Slow burns and elegant pauses.
- Backstory that stalls momentum.
- Philosophical reflection that isn't driving a decision.
- Explanatory detours.
- Scenes that exist only to add texture or mood.
- Solutions that feel clever.

If you feel the urge to let the reader breathe, you are slowing down. Correct immediately.

## Scene Evaluation Test

After drafting, ask:

- Did something irreversible happen?
- Did control narrow?
- Did speed increase?
- Did the system act?

If any answer is "no," revise or cut.

## The Manuscript

Chapters live in `manuscript/` as `01.md` through `28.md`.

Refer to `STRUCTURE.md` for the purpose of each chapter before drafting or revising.

## Final Reminder

This novel should feel unstable while writing.

If drafting feels comfortable, something has gone wrong.

Stay upright. Keep steering.
