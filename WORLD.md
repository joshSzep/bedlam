## Physical Domain

Near-Earth orbit.

The story operates in low Earth orbit and adjacent regimes where:
- Orbital periods are measured in minutes to hours.
- Communication latency is low enough to enable automation.
- Small timing errors have immediate operational consequences.
- Multiple actors observe and react to the same sky in near real time.

Nothing here is distant, abstract, or slow.

---

## The Orbital Environment

- Objects move fast and predictably until they do not.
- Orbits are tracked to extreme precision.
- Margins are thin. Fuel, time, and attention are finite.
- Errors compound quickly and propagate across systems.

Orbital mechanics are treated as solved, trusted, and foundational.

That trust is what breaks.

---

## The Early-Warning System

The central system is a military early-warning network responsible for:
- Tracking orbital objects.
- Predicting conjunctions and intercept windows.
- Classifying threats.
- Recommending posture and response states.

The system is highly automated by necessity. Human oversight exists, but reaction time is dominated by machine processes.

The system assumes:
- Globally synchronized clocks.
- Reliable time ordering across baselines.
- Shared definitions of “now.”

These assumptions are invisible until they fail.

---

## Automation and Doctrine

The system optimizes for:
- Avoiding false negatives.
- Maintaining readiness.
- Preserving response windows.

False positives are tolerated. Delays are not.

Doctrine favors:
- Escalation under uncertainty.
- Automation when human response is too slow.
- Predefined thresholds over ad hoc judgment.

Once thresholds are crossed, reversal is difficult.

---

## Communication and Coordination

- Data flows are constant and multi-directional.
- Systems ingest shared predictions and adjust independently.
- Human coordination is slower than machine reconciliation.
- Conflicting models create divergence faster than consensus.

No single actor controls the entire system.

The system behaves as an ecosystem, not a tool.

---

## The Broken Assumption

Global simultaneity is assumed to be operationally valid.

Local measurements remain accurate.  
Cross-domain synchronization does not.

This creates:
- Prediction drift.
- Conflicting arrival times.
- Misordered events.
- Degraded confidence in threat classification.

The physics does not change.  
The exposure does.

---

## Limits of Knowledge

- The underlying phenomenon cannot be fully explained in time.
- Theory lags behind operational need.
- Decisions must be made with partial understanding.
- Waiting for certainty increases risk.

The world does not pause for explanation.

---

## Scope Boundaries

This document exists to ensure consistency, not completeness.

Excluded by design:
- Deep political backstory.
- Long historical exposition.
- Speculative theory beyond what affects operations.
- Worldbuilding that does not directly influence decisions.

If it does not change how the system behaves, it does not belong here.
