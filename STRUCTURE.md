# STRUCTURE

This document defines the high-level narrative spine of *Bedlam*.

It exists to preserve momentum and prevent structural drift.  
It is intentionally minimal. No scene-level detail belongs here.

## Act I: Discovery and Ingestion (Chapters 1–7)

1. **Early Warning**  
   An intercept warning fires early. The anomaly is detected during routine verification.

2. **Instrument Check**  
   Sensor error is ruled out. Independent systems confirm the timing discrepancy.

3. **Pattern Recognition**  
   Multiple objects exhibit the same early arrival behavior across larger baselines.

4. **Local Escalation**  
   The anomaly is flagged internally. Initial concern remains contained.

5. **System Recommendation**  
   The protagonist recommends system-level reconciliation to cross-validate quietly.

6. **Ingestion**  
   The early-warning network ingests the data and reweights global predictions.

7. **Posture Shift**  
   A readiness posture change occurs without direct human authorization.

## Act II: Automation Outpaces Control (Chapters 8–15)

8. **Near Miss**  
   Automated avoidance maneuvers trigger earlier than expected.

9. **Fuel Burn**  
   Satellites expend limited resources to compensate for degraded predictions.

10. **Conflicting Futures**  
    Different subsystems produce incompatible threat timelines.

11. **Command Denial**  
    Attempts to pause escalation are rejected by doctrine and thresholds.

12. **Secondary Collision**  
    A real collision or destructive event occurs due to frame disagreement.

13. **Attribution Failure**  
    Responsibility for the event cannot be assigned confidently.

14. **Doctrine Tightens**  
    Defensive thresholds are lowered to compensate for uncertainty.

15. **Human Lag**  
    Human coordination fails to keep pace with automated response.

## Act III: Understanding Too Late (Chapters 16–21)

16. **Frame Isolation**  
    The timing failure is isolated as a synchronization issue, not a sensor fault.

17. **Clock Divergence**  
    Cross-domain clock correlation is shown to be unreliable.

18. **Exposure Realized**  
    The system’s dependence on global simultaneity is exposed.

19. **Attempted Explanation**  
    The protagonist attempts to communicate the root cause.

20. **Rejected Fix**  
    The proposed solution is deemed too risky or doctrinally unacceptable.

21. **Imminent Escalation**  
    The system approaches a point of no return.

## Act IV: Sabotage as Salvation (Chapters 22–26)

22. **Local Frame Proposal**  
    A fallback to local, causally ordered frames is proposed.

23. **Final Denial**  
    Authorization is refused under standing rules.

24. **Unauthorized Action**  
    The protagonist acts without approval.

25. **System Blindness**  
    Global synchronization is intentionally degraded.

26. **Escalation Halts**  
    Automated escalation slows or stops as uncertainty increases.

---

## Act V: Aftermath (Chapters 27–28)

27. **Investigation**  
    The intervention is examined, contained, and reclassified.

28. **Quiet Survival**  
    The world continues under degraded capability. The cost is permanent.

## Structural Principle

Every chapter must:
- Reduce control.
- Increase speed.
- Narrow options.

If a chapter does not actively worsen the situation, it violates the structure.
