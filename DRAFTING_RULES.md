# DRAFTING RULES

These rules exist to preserve speed, instability, and forward motion.

They are constraints, not suggestions.

---

## Core Rule

**If a chapter ends and the world is not more dangerous than before, the chapter is wrong.**

---

## Chapter Discipline

- Target length: 1,500–2,500 words.
- Chapters are numbered, not titled.
- No chapter exists solely to explain.
- No chapter ends with understanding or relief.
- Every chapter must reduce margin, options, or control.

If nothing changes externally, cut the chapter.

---

## Momentum Enforcement

- Explanations must occur during action.
- If a concept requires more than a paragraph, defer or delete it.
- Internal reflection is allowed only if it leads directly to a decision.
- If a scene feels elegant, slow down and cut it in half.

Elegance is a warning sign.

---

## Character Behavior Under Pressure

- Characters act before they are certain.
- Mistakes are understandable, not stupid.
- Confidence is punished quickly.
- Hesitation transfers authority to automation.

If a character pauses too long, the system moves without them.

---

## Science Usage

- Show physics through consequences, not lectures.
- Trust the reader to follow operational logic.
- Use numbers sparingly but precisely.
- If the science feels impressive, it is probably slowing the story.

Consistency matters more than completeness.

---

## Scene Evaluation Test

After drafting a scene, ask:

- Did something irreversible happen?
- Did control narrow?
- Did speed increase?
- Did the system act?

If the answer to any is “no,” revise or cut.

---

## Writing Session Rules

- Start where things are already moving.
- End sessions mid-motion if possible.
- Do not reread more than one chapter back.
- Do not polish while drafting.

Forward is the only direction.

---

## Warning Signs

If you feel the urge to:
- Add backstory.
- Explain theory.
- Linger on atmosphere.
- “Let the reader breathe.”

You are slowing down.

Correct immediately.

---

## Final Reminder

This novel should feel unstable while writing.

If drafting feels comfortable, safe, or controlled, something has gone wrong.

Stay upright. Keep steering.
