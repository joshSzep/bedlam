# CONSTRAINTS

These constraints define the non-negotiable boundaries of *Bedlam*.

If the manuscript violates them, it is no longer the novel this project set out to write.

---

## Structural Constraints

- The inciting failure occurs immediately.
- The plot advances through consequences, not discovery.
- Understanding always lags behind action.
- Escalation is driven by systems, not individual malice.
- The ending stops the spiral without restoring safety.

There are no recovery chapters.

---

## Chapter Constraints

- No chapter ends with clarity, certainty, or resolution.
- Every chapter worsens the situation in at least one measurable way.
- Chapters must change the external state of the world.
- Chapters that only add texture or mood are invalid.

If nothing breaks, shifts, or escalates, the chapter does not belong.

---

## Character Constraints

- The protagonist acts wrongly early in the story.
- The mistake is reasonable and defensible.
- Characters make decisions under time pressure.
- Hesitation empowers automation.
- No character fully understands the system they are trapped in.

Competence does not equal control.

---

## System Constraints

- Automation behaves according to doctrine and optimization, not intent.
- The system escalates faster than humans can coordinate.
- Reversal is always harder than escalation.
- Safety margins shrink monotonically.

There is no reset button.

---

## Science Constraints

- All science must obey physical law.
- No speculative fixes introduced late.
- No deus ex machina.
- Consistency matters more than explanation.

If a solution feels clever or elegant, it is suspect.

---

## Tone Constraints

- No calm interludes.
- No lyrical digressions during escalation.
- No extended philosophical reflection.
- Tension must be continuous.

The story may slow briefly, but it never stops.

---

## Ending Constraints

- The world survives narrowly.
- The underlying phenomenon remains unresolved.
- The system is made worse on purpose to regain control.
- The cost is permanent and personal.

Relief is allowed. Triumph is not.

---

## Final Check

If at any point the manuscript feels:
- Safe.
- Clean.
- Fully explained.
- Comforting.

These constraints have been violated.

Correct course immediately.
