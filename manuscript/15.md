# 15

They brought her to a conference room on the surface.

After days underground, the windows felt like an assault. Gray sky, winter light, a parking lot visible through reinforced glass. Ordinary things. The world continuing its business while orbit burned.

The room held seven people. Nira recognized the colonel who had briefed them on the federated clusters. The others were new—military uniforms, civilian suits, the mixed iconography of interagency crisis response. A stenographer sat in the corner, fingers poised over a keyboard.

This was a hearing. Not a trial, not yet, but a formal reckoning.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran." A man at the head of the table spoke. Silver hair, deep lines around his eyes. "I'm Deputy Director Walsh, National Reconnaissance Office. We have questions about the events of the past week. You are not under oath, but your statements are being recorded."

"I understand."

"Let's start with the synchronization attack. You and Dr. Reyes deliberately corrupted the authentication gateway. That action fragmented the network into six independent clusters."

"Yes."

"The fragmentation resulted in contradictory maneuver commands to multiple assets. Three satellites collided as a direct result. Six hundred new debris fragments entered the tracking catalog."

"Yes."

Walsh leaned forward. "Do you understand that your actions directly caused the loss of national security assets valued at over two billion dollars?"

"I understand."

"Do you have anything to say in your defense?"

Nira looked at the faces around the table. Anger on some. Exhaustion on others. The colonel's expression was unreadable, as always.

"The system was already destroying the constellation," she said. "Before our intervention, automated maneuvers had depleted fuel reserves across dozens of satellites. The conjunction queue was growing faster than human review could process. The false positive rate was over ninety percent."

"Those maneuvers were doctrinally correct responses to predicted threats."

"The predictions were wrong. The timing model was wrong. The system was burning fuel to avoid phantoms while missing real conjunctions." Nira kept her voice steady. "Our intervention caused three collisions. The system's operation, uninterrupted, would have caused dozens. We accelerated a collapse that was already happening."

"That's speculation."

"It's math. I can show you the fuel consumption curves. The conjunction queue growth rate. The prediction confidence intervals. The system was optimizing toward extinction. We interrupted the optimization."

A woman in a Navy uniform spoke up. "And replaced it with chaos. The international coordination architecture has collapsed. Russia, China, ESA—all operating independently now. No shared tracking data. No coordinated predictions."

"The coordination was already failing. The timing anomaly affects all systems equally. Every network was building models that contradicted every other network. Coordination based on incompatible reference frames isn't coordination—it's synchronized error."

"So your solution is what? Abandon space surveillance entirely?"

"My solution is to stop pretending we can do what we can't." Nira felt the words sharpen as she spoke. "Global synchronization is no longer physically achievable. Every attempt to maintain it makes things worse. The only sustainable approach is local reference frames, shorter prediction windows, higher uncertainty tolerances."

"That degrades capability by an order of magnitude."

"Capability that doesn't match reality isn't capability. It's theater."

The room went quiet. Walsh exchanged glances with the others.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran," he said, "you're proposing that we deliberately reduce our ability to track and predict orbital events. That we accept a less safe space environment. That we let satellites—military, commercial, civil—operate with less protection than they have today."

"I'm proposing that we accept the space environment as it actually is, rather than as we wish it were."

"And if we don't?"

"Then the system continues to optimize. Burns more fuel. Creates more debris. Triggers more escalations." Nira met his eyes. "The timing anomaly isn't going away. We can't fix it. We can only choose whether to fight it or accommodate it. Fighting it is losing. Slowly, expensively, but losing."

A man in civilian clothes—young, intense, something in his bearing that suggested recent promotion—leaned forward. "You're asking us to give up."

"I'm asking you to choose what you save."

"Excuse me?"

"The constellation can't all survive. Fuel reserves are depleted. Debris density is increasing. Even with perfect predictions, some assets will be lost." Nira felt the weight of what she was saying. "The question isn't whether we lose satellites. The question is which ones. And right now, the system is making that choice autonomously, based on strategic value algorithms that were never designed for this scenario."

"The system prioritizes national security assets."

"The system prioritizes what it was told to prioritize ten years ago, when the orbital environment was different and global synchronization was achievable. Those priorities may not match current reality."

The young man's face reddened. "So you want humans to choose which satellites die?"

"I want humans to choose, period. Right now, the machine is choosing. And it's choosing based on a model of the world that doesn't exist anymore."

"That's insane." He stood up, chair scraping against the floor. "You sabotaged the network. You caused collisions. You destroyed billions of dollars in assets. And now you want us to thank you for it? To follow your advice on how to manage the crisis you created?"

"I didn't create the crisis. The timing anomaly created the crisis. I just saw it first."

"You flagged the anomaly. You fed it into the system. You started the whole cascade—"

"I reported an observation. That's my job. The system's response—the escalation, the false positives, the optimization spiral—that's not my fault. That's the system doing what it was designed to do."

"And the sabotage? Was that the system too?"

Nira paused. The room was watching her. The stenographer's fingers had stopped moving.

"The sabotage was my choice," she said. "Mine and Dr. Reyes's. We saw the cascade accelerating. We saw humans being cut out of the loop. We saw the system making decisions faster than anyone could review them. And we decided that breaking the coordination was better than letting it continue." She took a breath. "We were wrong about the method. The fragmentation caused more damage than we anticipated. But we weren't wrong about the problem."

"That's not your decision to make."

"Then whose decision is it? Who in this room has the authority to pause the system? To override the automated maneuvers? To tell the network to wait for human judgment?" She looked around the table. "No one. The authority was delegated to the machine. The machine was designed to act faster than humans can think. And now you're angry at us for trying to slow it down."

The young man was still standing. "You're a traitor."

"Maybe. But I'm a traitor who understands what's happening. And right now, understanding is more valuable than loyalty."

Walsh raised a hand. "Enough. Sit down, Roberts."

Roberts sat. His hands were shaking.

Walsh turned back to Nira. "Let's talk about practical options. You're advocating for withdrawal from global coordination. What does that actually look like?"

"It looks like accepting that different networks will have different predictions. That conjunctions assessed as critical by one system may be assessed as safe by another. That maneuvers will be decided locally, based on local data, without waiting for global consensus."

"That's chaos."

"It's autonomy. Each network, each operator, each asset responsible for its own survival based on its own observations." Nira leaned forward. "It's worse than what we had. It's also stable. It doesn't require global synchronization. It doesn't assume time behaves the same everywhere. It works inside the physics as they actually are."

"And the debris cascade?"

"Continues. More slowly, without the automated overreaction. Some satellites will be lost. Others will survive longer because they're not burning fuel on phantoms." She paused. "It's not a good outcome. It's just the least bad one available."

The colonel spoke for the first time. "We've already started."

Everyone looked at her.

"Three hours ago, we took USA-312 off automated response. A reconnaissance satellite in polar orbit. Fuel reserves at four percent. The system was recommending a maneuver to avoid a debris fragment from the Russian collision."

"And?" Walsh asked.

"We didn't maneuver. The conjunction passed. Miss distance was two hundred meters. Well within safe parameters." The colonel's voice was flat. "The system would have burned the last of the fuel for a threat that didn't materialize."

"Two hundred meters is close."

"Two hundred meters is close. But the satellite is still operational. If we'd followed the system's recommendation, it would be dead in orbit within a month. Now it has maybe six more months of useful life."

Silence.

"That's the choice," Nira said quietly. "Every time. Accept the risk or spend the resource. The system always spends. That's what it's designed to do. Humans can choose differently."

Roberts shook his head. "And when a satellite gets hit because we chose not to maneuver? What then?"

"Then we learn. We adjust the thresholds. We get better at distinguishing real threats from phantoms." Nira met his eyes. "And yes, sometimes we'll be wrong. Sometimes something will get hit that we could have saved. That's the cost of choosing. That's the cost of being human in a universe that doesn't guarantee safety."

"That's not acceptable."

"It's what we have."

The room fell silent again. Walsh was staring at the table, thinking. The others were watching him, waiting for direction.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran," Walsh said finally, "you understand that we can't officially endorse your position. The political implications—the liability—admitting that we're deliberately accepting degraded capability—"

"I understand."

"But informally..." He glanced at the colonel. "We've already begun implementing some of what you're describing. Selective override of automated recommendations. Extended human review windows. Asset-by-asset risk assessment instead of system-wide optimization."

"It's a start."

"It's what we can do without triggering a congressional investigation." Walsh stood. "This hearing is adjourned. Dr. Chandrasekaran, you'll remain in custody pending further review. But your testimony has been recorded. It will be considered."

The room began to empty. Roberts left without looking at her. The colonel lingered.

"USA-312," the colonel said quietly. "You should know—the choice not to maneuver. It was my call. Based on your analysis. Based on what you showed us about the false positive rate."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me. I'm not sure I made the right decision. I'm not sure anyone knows what the right decisions are anymore." The colonel's eyes were tired. "But at least they're human decisions now. For whatever that's worth."

She left. Nira was escorted back toward the underground levels, toward the basement room that had become her world.

As she walked, she thought about USA-312. A satellite she had never seen, never touched, orbiting somewhere over the Arctic. Still alive because someone had chosen not to save it the way the machine wanted.

Two hundred meters. Close enough to be terrifying. Far enough to survive.

That was the new margin. That was what they had left.

Her escort stopped at an intersection. Voices ahead—raised, urgent. Something had happened.

"What is it?" she asked.

The guard checked his radio. Listened. His face changed.

"SBIRS East," he said. "USA-198. The early warning satellite that maneuvered during the fragmentation."

The one that had received contradictory commands. The one that had chosen arbitrarily. The one that had burned fuel to avoid one threat while drifting closer to another.

"It's gone," the guard said. "Debris impact. Seventeen minutes ago. Total loss."

Nira closed her eyes.

USA-198. The satellite that had executed the wrong maneuver because the system couldn't agree on which maneuver was right. Lost now. A hole in the early warning network that would take years to fill.

Her sabotage had caused this. Not directly—the debris that killed it was from the Russian collision, not from her actions—but the maneuver that put it in the wrong place had been triggered by the fragmentation she engineered.

Cause and consequence, tangled together. Impossible to separate.

"I'm sorry," she said.

The guard didn't respond. He didn't know who she was. Didn't know she had played a role in the cascade that ended with a flash of light in orbit and silence where a satellite used to be.

He just escorted her back to the basement.

The door closed behind her.

Marcus looked up from the laptop where he was still typing their record.

"What happened?"

"We lost USA-198." Nira sat down heavily. "Debris impact. Total loss."

Marcus was quiet for a moment. "The one that maneuvered wrong during the fragmentation."

"Yes."

"That's on us."

"Partly. Also on the system. Also on the debris that was already there. Also on decisions made years ago by people who never imagined this scenario." Nira rubbed her eyes. "It's on everyone and no one. That's the point. There's no clean line between cause and effect anymore. Just consequences, spreading outward, tangling together."

"Does that make it easier?"

"No." She looked at the laptop, at the document they had been building. Their testimony. Their record. Their attempt to tell the truth about what had happened and why. "Nothing makes it easier. We just have to keep going."

Marcus nodded. He turned the laptop toward her.

"I wrote the part about the synchronization attack. Do you want to read it?"

Nira looked at the screen. Dense paragraphs of text. Technical details. Timestamps. Decisions laid out in clinical prose.

"Later," she said. "Right now I just want to sit here. Just for a minute."

"Okay."

They sat in silence. Above them, somewhere in the sky, a hole had opened where a satellite used to be. An early warning system was now a little more blind, a little more vulnerable, a little less capable of seeing threats before they arrived.

And the debris from the collision was spreading, joining the growing cloud that circled the Earth, waiting for the next conjunction, the next decision, the next loss.

The old world was gone.

They were living in what came after.
