They came for Volkov first.

Nira learned about it from a gap in the data—the Vostochny tracking feed went dark at 06:23 UTC, three hours after her broadcast. One moment the station was contributing observations to the shadow catalog, the next moment silence. No warning. No message. Just absence where information used to be.

"FSB," Marcus said. He was still beside her in Geneva, both of them now surrounded by a security detail that had shifted from "protective custody" to something closer to "pre-arrest containment." "They've been tracking the network for weeks. Your broadcast gave them the justification they needed."

"Will he be okay?"

"He's a Russian citizen who helped build an international intelligence network that embarrassed the Kremlin. What do you think?"

Nira didn't answer. She knew what she thought. She also knew that thinking it wouldn't help anyone.

The security team leader approached. His name was Reeves, American, with the flat affect of someone who had spent too many years in jobs that required not caring about the people he handled.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran. We're moving you in thirty minutes."

"Moving me where?"

"Ramstein. Then stateside. The Justice Department wants you in federal custody."

"I thought I was already in custody."

"You're in protective supervision under international cooperation protocols. That's about to change." He glanced at Marcus. "Dr. Chen, you're being released. Swiss authorities have declined to cooperate with the US extradition request for you."

"And Nira?"

"Dr. Chandrasekaran is a US citizen who committed crimes under US jurisdiction. Different rules."

Marcus looked at her. The expression on his face was something she hadn't seen before—helplessness mixed with guilt, the look of someone watching a friend drown while standing on solid ground.

"I'll keep the network running," he said. "Whatever happens."

"I know."

"The data doesn't stop because they arrest me. The truth doesn't stop."

"I know."

Reeves stepped between them. "Thirty minutes, Dr. Chandrasekaran. I suggest you use them."

The shadow catalog continued to function.

Vostochny was gone, but there were eleven other stations still contributing. The fusion algorithm adapted, recalculating confidence intervals, adjusting for the reduced coverage. The predictions got slightly less accurate—but only slightly. The network had been built for resilience.

At 07:15 UTC, the European Space Agency made a decision.

A Sentinel-6 ocean monitoring satellite was in the conjunction queue. Debris from the Kessler band had drifted higher than initial projections, threatening the satellite's orbit at an altitude that was supposed to be safe.

The official ESA tracking system showed a 2.3 percent collision probability. Manageable. Within tolerance.

The shadow catalog showed 11.7 percent. Not manageable. Not even close.

"We're maneuvering," the ESA operations director announced on the coordination loop. The same loop that had tried and failed to save the ISS. "Based on shadow catalog prediction. Burn in forty-five minutes."

"That's not authorized," the American liaison objected. "ESA policy requires—"

"ESA policy requires us to protect our assets. The shadow catalog is the most accurate data source available. We're using it."

"The US government has formally requested that allied nations cease cooperation with the criminal network—"

"Then the US government can explain to European taxpayers why we lost a three-hundred-million-euro satellite following American political guidance instead of physical reality."

The argument continued. But the decision was made.

Sentinel-6 maneuvered at 08:00 UTC, burning precious fuel to dodge debris that the official systems barely acknowledged. The shadow catalog prediction proved accurate—tracking confirmed the fragment passed within sixty meters of where the satellite would have been.

Truth won. This time.

But the victory came with a cost. The American liaison formally protested. The State Department issued a statement condemning ESA's "reckless reliance on unverified intelligence sources." And somewhere in Washington, someone added ESA to a list of organizations that had chosen the wrong side.

The transport convoy left Geneva at 09:30 UTC.

Three vehicles. Armed escort. Nira in the middle car, hands not cuffed but not free either, watching through tinted windows as Switzerland slid past. Mountains and lakes and the kind of peaceful scenery that felt like a mockery of everything happening above.

Her phone was gone. Her laptop was gone. Her connection to the shadow network was severed. She was a passenger now, being carried toward a destination she hadn't chosen, to face consequences she had accepted but still feared.

The convoy stopped at a checkpoint. German border. The security team exchanged documents with officials who looked nervous about something.

"Problem?" Reeves asked into his radio.

"German federal police. They want to inspect the convoy."

"We have diplomatic clearance."

"They say the clearance has been revoked. Something about the detainee's status under EU asylum provisions."

Nira felt something shift. The Germans were stalling. Why?

The answer came forty minutes later, when the checkpoint finally cleared and the convoy crossed into Germany—but turned north instead of toward Ramstein.

"Change of plans," Reeves said. His voice was tight. "You're not going stateside."

"Then where?"

"The Hague. International Criminal Court. Someone filed a motion claiming the US prosecution is politically motivated and requesting temporary transfer to international jurisdiction."

"Who filed it?"

"I don't know. But whoever they are, they just bought you time."

Time. The resource that kept running out for everyone except her.

The shadow catalog recorded the collision at 11:47 UTC.

Not in the Kessler band. Higher. Much higher.

COLLISION EVENT - MAJOR
Object 1: SES-17 (Communications satellite, GEO transfer orbit)
Object 2: Debris fragment (Origin: Cosmos-1408 cascade, migrated altitude)
Location: 2,847 km altitude
Impact velocity: 2.1 km/s
Satellite status: DESTROYED
Debris generated: Estimated 890 fragments

SES-17. A communications satellite serving the Americas and Europe. Television broadcasts. Internet backbone. Emergency services relay for a dozen Caribbean nations.

Gone.

The debris from the Kessler band had climbed higher than anyone projected. The cascade wasn't staying contained. It was spreading upward, reaching toward the orbital shells that held the infrastructure the world actually depended on.

"That's not supposed to happen," one of the ESA analysts said on the coordination loop. "The migration rate—the debris shouldn't reach that altitude for months."

"The models were wrong."

"The models were based on historical fragmentation data. This cascade is different. The fragment velocities are higher. The collision energy is distributing differently."

"So what does that mean for the GEO belt?"

Silence. Then: "It means we have less time than we thought."

The geostationary belt. 36,000 kilometers up. The orbit where communications satellites hovered in fixed positions, providing the backbone for global broadcasting, weather monitoring, and military communications.

If the cascade reached GEO, the consequences would be measured not in satellite losses but in civilizational capability. The ability to communicate across oceans. The ability to see weather systems forming. The ability to coordinate anything at global scale.

"How long?" someone asked.

"Based on current migration rates... six to eight weeks. Maybe less."

Six weeks. Not months. Weeks.

The clock had just accelerated again.

Nira arrived at The Hague at 14:00 UTC.

The International Criminal Court building was modern, glass and steel, designed to project legitimacy and permanence. Inside, it felt like a holding pattern—lawyers and officials moving through corridors with the purposeful uncertainty of people managing situations that had no precedent.

They put her in a conference room with a window overlooking the city. Not a cell. Not yet.

A woman entered. Dutch, professional, with the kind of calm that came from handling crises for a living.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran. I'm Dr. Helena Vos, representing the Office of the Prosecutor. You should know that your presence here is... irregular."

"I'm aware."

"The motion that brought you here was filed by an anonymous party. The legal basis is questionable. The United States is already protesting through diplomatic channels." Vos sat across from her. "But you're here, and while you're here, you have certain protections."

"What kind of protections?"

"The kind that come with being a potential witness in an investigation that hasn't officially opened yet."

"An investigation into what?"

"Into whether the actions that led to the current orbital crisis constitute crimes against humanity." Vos paused. "The deliberate destruction of shared global infrastructure. The creation of conditions that have already killed hundreds and may kill thousands more. The knowing continuation of activities that guaranteed catastrophic outcomes."

"You're talking about Russia. The ASAT test."

"I'm talking about everyone. Russia. The United States. China. The commercial operators who knew their systems were failing and kept them running anyway. The governments that prioritized national interest over collective survival." Vos leaned forward. "The shadow catalog you built is the only comprehensive record of what happened and why. If there's ever going to be accountability for this, it will be because someone preserved the truth."

"The shadow catalog isn't mine. It belongs to everyone who built it."

"And everyone who built it is currently being arrested, intimidated, or silenced. You're the public face. The one who went on camera and told the world what was happening. If you disappear into an American prison, the narrative becomes: the criminal got caught. The threat was contained. Everything is under control."

"Everything isn't under control."

"No. But that's the story they want to tell. And without you—without someone willing to keep saying the truth out loud—they might succeed."

Nira looked out the window. The Hague. The city where the world had decided, after too many wars, that there should be rules. That actions should have consequences. That truth should matter.

It hadn't worked, mostly. The powerful still did what they wanted. The rules still bent for those who could afford to bend them.

But sometimes—rarely—the truth survived long enough to matter.

"What do you need from me?"

"Everything. The complete shadow catalog archives. The communications records. The decision timeline showing who knew what and when. The evidence that this wasn't an accident—it was a choice, made by people who understood the consequences and made it anyway."

"That's treason. Against my own country."

"That's testimony. In service of humanity."

The distinction felt thin. But so did everything else.

"I'll do it," Nira said. "But you need to understand—the crisis isn't over. The cascade is accelerating. We might have weeks before the GEO belt becomes unreachable. Whatever investigation you're planning, it needs to happen now, not in years."

"Why now?"

"Because in six weeks, there might not be any communications infrastructure left to broadcast the findings. The truth only matters if someone can hear it."

The prediction came at 16:23 UTC.

The shadow catalog, running on reduced capacity but still functional, had been tracking the debris migration patterns. The SES-17 collision had scattered fragments across a range of altitudes, and those fragments were now being tracked, cataloged, assessed.

One of them was on a trajectory that would reach geosynchronous altitude in eleven days.

Not "might reach." Would reach. The orbit was stable, the velocity confirmed, the mathematics inexorable.

And when it arrived, it would pass through the orbital slot occupied by GOES-18—the primary weather satellite for the western United States. The satellite that tracked hurricanes, monitored wildfires, provided the data that let millions of people know when to evacuate.

CONJUNCTION PREDICTION - CRITICAL
Object: SES-17 debris fragment (estimated 2.3 kg)
Target: GOES-18 (Weather satellite, GEO)
TCA: 11 days, 7 hours
Probability: 67%
Consequence: Loss of primary western US weather monitoring

Sixty-seven percent. In eleven days.

The debris couldn't be moved. GOES-18 couldn't maneuver—it had no fuel reserves for emergency repositioning. There was no technological solution, no clever intervention, no last-minute save.

In eleven days, there was a two-in-three chance that the western United States would lose its primary weather satellite. Right as wildfire season continued. Right as another storm system was forming in the Pacific.

The shadow catalog broadcast the prediction. Every participating station. Every news outlet that would listen. Every government that was still pretending the crisis was under control.

Nira watched the numbers from her conference room in The Hague.

Eleven days.

She had told the truth. She had built a network that preserved it. She had sacrificed everything—her career, her freedom, her country—to make sure the world could see what was happening.

And now she could only watch as the sky continued to fall.

The cascade wasn't waiting for accountability.

The cascade wasn't waiting for testimony.

The cascade wasn't waiting for anything.

In eleven days, the truth would arrive at GOES-18's orbital slot traveling at three kilometers per second.

And nothing anyone said would change the trajectory.

Only action could do that now.

If there was any action left to take.
