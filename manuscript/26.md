The Dragon capsule shuddered as something passed close enough to register on proximity sensors.

Vasquez was strapped into the commander's seat, four crew members packed around her in a space designed for comfort on a two-day journey to Earth, now serving as an escape pod for a forty-minute sprint to safety. Through the small window, she could see the ISS receding—still intact, still lit, still broadcasting its automated systems check like nothing had changed.

"Proximity alert," the capsule announced. "Object tracking. Range: two hundred twelve meters. Closing."

Two hundred meters. In orbital terms, that was a near-collision. In a spacecraft with no maneuvering authority during the critical descent burn, it was helplessness.

"Houston, Dragon. We have debris tracking on approach. Confirm you're monitoring."

"Dragon, Houston. We see it. Object appears to be passing below your trajectory. Maintain current attitude."

Appears to be. The uncertainty that had poisoned everything was here too, inside the capsule that was supposed to carry them to safety. The predictions were better now—the shadow catalog had tightened the confidence intervals—but better wasn't certain. Better wasn't safe.

The object passed. Or didn't hit them. The distinction felt meaningless.

"Deorbit burn in four minutes," Tanaka said from the seat beside her. "Then we're committed."

Committed. The word astronauts used for the moment when the math became destiny. Once they burned, they were coming down. No second chances. No abort options.

Behind them, through the rear cameras, the ISS grew smaller.

The Soyuz launched three minutes after Dragon began its deorbit burn.

Petrov was aboard with the two remaining crew members—DuPont and Sharma, pressed into the Russian capsule because there hadn't been time to reconfigure the seating. The spacecraft was cramped in ways the Dragon wasn't, Soviet engineering prioritizing function over comfort.

"Separation confirmed," Moscow Control announced. "Soyuz, you are free of station. Begin departure sequence."

Petrov watched the ISS through the periscope. The station he had helped build, had lived in for six months, was now floating alone. The lights were still on. The solar arrays were still tracking the sun. The automated systems would keep everything running for hours, maybe days.

But no one was coming back.

"Soyuz, Moscow. We are tracking multiple debris objects in your departure corridor. Recommend expedited burn sequence."

"Understood, Moscow. Beginning expedited burn."

The engines fired. The Soyuz pulled away from the station, trading one set of risks for another. Behind them, the ISS began its long fall into abandonment.

---

The station died slowly.

Not all at once—that would have been dramatic, cinematic, the kind of ending that made sense in stories. Instead, it died the way complex systems die: one failure cascading into another, each breakdown triggering the next.

The first sign was the attitude drift.

Without crew to monitor and correct, the station's orientation began to shift. The control moment gyroscopes compensated, then over-compensated, then fell into a hunting pattern that consumed power faster than the solar arrays could generate.

Forty-seven minutes after evacuation, the station's automated systems attempted an emergency reboost. The thrusters fired—but the attitude was wrong, the burn vector off by three degrees. Instead of raising the orbit, it induced a rotation.

The ISS began to tumble.

Slowly at first. A gentle roll that would have been imperceptible to anyone inside. But the roll built on itself, the gyroscopes unable to counter the momentum, the solar arrays losing their lock on the sun.

Power dropped. Heating failed. The temperature inside the modules began to fall.

At 17:23 UTC, the station broadcast its final automated status update.

*ISS Status: Attitude control failure. Power generation critical. Thermal regulation offline. Estimated time to systems failure: 4 hours 17 minutes.*

The message repeated every fifteen minutes, growing weaker as the batteries drained. A mechanical voice announcing its own death to anyone still listening.

Ground stations tracked the tumble. Cameras captured the image that would define the end of an era: the International Space Station, humanity's greatest collaborative achievement, spinning slowly against the stars, its solar panels catching sunlight in strobing flashes as it rotated through orientations it was never meant to hold.

Twenty-three years of continuous human presence in space.

Over.

In Geneva, Nira watched the telemetry fade.

The shadow catalog was still tracking the station—still generating conjunction predictions for an object that no longer mattered—but the life had gone out of the data. Just numbers now. Trajectory and velocity and the slow mathematics of orbital decay.

"It'll reenter in about two weeks," Marcus said. He was beside her, both of them still technically in custody, both of them watching the end of something neither had expected to witness. "Most of it will burn up. Some debris will reach the surface."

"Where?"

"Depends on the decay rate. Probably the Pacific. They designed the deorbit corridor for that."

"There is no controlled deorbit. There's no one to control it."

"Then wherever physics decides." He paused. "The Southern Hemisphere, most likely. Low population density. Probably no casualties."

Probably. The word that had lost all meaning.

The operations center was quieter than it should have been. The evacuation had succeeded—both capsules on trajectory, both crews safe for now—but there was no celebration. The ISS was dying, and everyone knew what had killed it.

"The shadow catalog," Weber said. She had approached without Nira noticing. "Your network. It's become... essential."

"I know."

"The official position is that it's an intelligence breach. Criminal conspiracy. Governments are required to denounce it."

"I know that too."

"But the operational teams—the people who actually manage satellites, who actually track debris, who actually make decisions that matter—they're all using it now. Not publicly. Not officially. But it's the only source of predictions they trust."

"What are you telling me?"

Weber looked at the tracking display. The ISS, tumbling. The debris cloud, spreading. The conjunction queue, growing.

"I'm telling you that the shadow catalog just became the de facto global standard for orbital awareness. Not because anyone chose it. Because everything else failed."

The legitimacy flip. The moment when an illegal network became the only authority that mattered.

"What do you want me to do about it?"

"Nothing. Yet." Weber lowered her voice. "But someone is going to have to be the face of it. Someone who can explain what it is, how it works, why it should be trusted. Someone who can stand up in front of the world and say: this is the truth, and I take responsibility for it."

"That someone would be prosecuted. Probably imprisoned."

"Yes."

"And you're asking me to do it anyway."

"I'm telling you it needs to be done. The choice is yours."

Weber walked away.

Nira stared at the display. The ISS was almost out of frame now, its tumble carrying it beyond the camera's view. A hundred billion dollars. Twenty-three years. Seven partner nations. All of it spinning into oblivion because systems had failed in ways no one could have predicted.

Except someone had predicted it. The shadow catalog had shown exactly what the ASAT debris would do. And the world had launched anyway.

Her phone buzzed. Volkov.

*We need a spokesperson. Someone credible. Someone the world will listen to.*

*I know.*

*Will you do it?*

She thought about what it would cost. Her career—already destroyed. Her freedom—probably forfeit. Her anonymity—gone forever. She would become the face of the criminal network that had defied governments, exposed secrets, told truths that no one wanted to hear.

She would become the person everyone blamed for what came next.

*Yes.*

*Then we go public in six hours. Prepare a statement. The world needs to understand what's coming.*

The hurricane made landfall at 19:45 UTC.

Not the Gulf storm from earlier—that had dissipated over Louisiana, weaker than feared. This was a different system, a late-season cyclone that had formed in the Atlantic and strengthened faster than the degraded forecast models could track.

NOAA-20 was still operating at reduced capacity. The backup satellites were struggling to fill the gap. And the models that turned satellite data into predictions were running on timing infrastructure that no longer agreed with itself.

The forecast had called for Category 2. The reality was Category 4.

Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. A tourist town in the off-season, population sixty thousand permanent residents plus another twenty thousand who had stayed because the forecast said they could.

The evacuation order came too late.

Not everyone died. Most people made it to shelters, to higher ground, to the kinds of places that Category 2 preparations were designed to protect. But the storm surge that a Category 2 wouldn't have produced—the fifteen-foot wall of water that only Category 4 systems generate—that killed two hundred seventeen people who had trusted the forecast.

Nira learned about it from a news alert, sitting in the Geneva operations center, waiting for her moment to become the face of a revolution she had never intended to lead.

Two hundred seventeen people.

Because the satellites were broken. Because the timing was wrong. Because the predictions couldn't be trusted, and no one had told the public how bad it had gotten.

The shadow catalog couldn't have prevented the hurricane. But it might have improved the forecast. Might have given those two hundred seventeen people another few hours to evacuate.

If anyone had been listening.

If anyone had trusted the truth when it mattered.

At 22:00 UTC, the shadow catalog recorded the first autonomous cascade event.

Two debris fragments from the Cosmos-1408 cloud collided without any satellite involvement. Object 1408-B-117 struck object 1408-F-892 at a relative velocity of 340 meters per second. The impact generated forty-seven new fragments, each one adding to the conjunction queue, each one increasing the probability of the next collision.

The Kessler threshold.

Not in 72 hours. Now.

The debris was generating debris faster than atmospheric drag could remove it. The 400-420 kilometer band was entering self-sustaining cascade. Every day would be worse than the day before, until the entire orbital shell was unusable.

"It's started," Marcus said quietly.

"I know."

"There's no stopping it now. We can slow it, maybe. Protect what we can. But the cascade is self-sustaining. We've crossed the threshold."

"How long until it spreads?"

"The higher bands? Months. Maybe a year. The debris will gradually climb to higher altitudes through collision dynamics. Eventually it'll reach the GPS constellation. Then the GEO belt. Then..." He trailed off.

"Then everything."

"Then everything we've built in space becomes unreachable. For decades. Maybe longer."

Nira looked at the cascade simulation on the display. The debris cloud, growing. The collision frequency, climbing. The projection showing the orbital environment becoming progressively more dangerous until the risk curves went asymptotic.

This was what she had tried to prevent. What the shadow catalog had been built to stop. And they had failed—not completely, not in every way, but in the way that mattered most.

The sky was falling. And it would keep falling until there was nothing left to protect.

Her phone buzzed. The six-hour timer.

Time to tell the world.

---

The broadcast went out at 04:00 UTC.

Every major news network. Every wire service. Every social media platform that the shadow catalog's distributed infrastructure could reach. A simultaneous release to ensure that no government could suppress it before the message spread.

Nira's face appeared on screens across the planet.

"My name is Dr. Nira Chandrasekaran. I am a physicist and former analyst for the United States Space Force. For the past three weeks, I have been part of an international network of scientists and engineers working to create a single, accurate picture of the orbital environment—one that isn't corrupted by the timing discrepancies that have made government predictions unreliable."

She paused. Let the words land.

"Earlier today, the International Space Station was evacuated and abandoned. Two hundred seventeen people died in South Carolina because hurricane forecasts were wrong. And in the past six hours, the first self-sustaining debris cascade has begun in low Earth orbit."

"The shadow catalog I helped build predicted all of this. We shared our data with governments, with space agencies, with anyone who would listen. Some listened. Most didn't. The ones who didn't are now quietly using our data anyway, because it's the only data that works."

"I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm not asking for immunity. I broke laws to build this network, and I'll face whatever consequences come from that. But the truth matters more than my freedom. And the truth is this: the orbital environment is collapsing. The debris cascade cannot be stopped. Every day it continues, more satellites will be destroyed, more fragments will be created, and more of the infrastructure we depend on will become unreachable."

"This isn't an attack. It isn't sabotage. It isn't war. It's physics. It's what happens when systems optimized for competition encounter a problem that requires cooperation. We built networks that couldn't talk to each other, predictions that couldn't agree, responses that made everything worse. And now we're living with the consequences."

"The shadow catalog will continue to operate. It will provide the best predictions available to anyone who asks—governments, companies, researchers, individuals. We're not choosing sides. We're choosing reality. The reality is that space is becoming dangerous, and the only way through is together."

"I don't know what comes next. But whatever it is, at least we'll face it with our eyes open."

The broadcast ended.

Within minutes, the responses began.

The United States Department of Justice announced that Dr. Nira Chandrasekaran was wanted for espionage, unauthorized disclosure of classified information, and conspiracy to interfere with national security operations.

The European Space Agency announced that it was "evaluating" the shadow catalog as a potential backup data source.

China announced that the shadow catalog was "Western information warfare" and would be blocked from Chinese networks.

Russia announced nothing. But their tracking stations continued to pull data from the shadow feed, their operators silently integrating the truth they couldn't publicly acknowledge.

And in the collision-strewn orbital band above Earth's atmosphere, the cascade continued.

KESSLER CASCADE STATUS
Band: 400-420 km
Collision rate: 3.7 events/day (accelerating)
Fragment count: 24,847 (and climbing)
Time to band denial: 18 days
Time to cascade spread: 6-8 months

The clocks kept running.

The debris kept spreading.

And somewhere in the chaos, a new kind of order was being born—not from governments or institutions, but from the people who had decided that the truth mattered more than the lies they were told to believe.

Whatever came next, at least they would see it coming.

That had to be worth something.

Even if it wasn't enough.
