# 14

Hours passed. Or maybe minutes. The room had no windows, no clocks, nothing to measure time except the slow accumulation of exhaustion.

At some point, someone brought food. Nira ate without tasting it. Marcus slept in his chair, head tilted back, breathing shallow and uneven. The fluorescent lights hummed their constant hum.

She found herself thinking about small things.

The coffee maker in the operations center that always ran too hot. The squeak of the third-floor stairwell door. The way morning light came through the windows of her apartment, the one she hadn't seen in—how long? A week? Less?

The world was ending, and she was thinking about coffee and sunlight.

Maybe that was the only way to survive it. Shrink the frame until it fit something you could hold.

The door opened. Not the colonel this time. A young man in civilian clothes, carrying a laptop. He looked nervous—not afraid, but uncertain. Like someone who had been given instructions he didn't fully understand.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran?"

"Yes."

"I'm supposed to set up a communication link for you. Secure channel. Someone wants to talk to you."

"Who?"

"I don't know. I just set up the hardware." He placed the laptop on the table, opened it, typed a sequence of commands. The screen flickered, then resolved into a video call interface. "It should connect in about thirty seconds."

He left without another word.

Marcus stirred, blinking awake. "What's happening?"

"Someone wants to talk."

"Who?"

"I don't know."

The screen connected. A face appeared—older, tired, wearing the kind of expression that came from too many hours in rooms like this one. Nira didn't recognize him, but something about the background suggested a facility similar to theirs. Another basement. Another bunker. Another piece of the infrastructure that was supposed to protect the world.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran. Dr. Reyes." The man's voice was hoarse. "My name is Viktor Aronov. I am—was—senior analyst for Roscosmos early warning systems."

Russian. The data link they had severed. The network that had gone dark.

"I understand you are the ones who identified the timing anomaly," Aronov continued. "Before anyone else. Before the systems learned it."

"I flagged it," Nira said. "I didn't understand it."

"No one understands it. That is not why I am calling." Aronov leaned closer to the camera. "I am calling because I have been watching my own network destroy itself for three days. I have seen the same patterns you have seen. The false positives. The fuel consumption. The cascading maneuvers. The debris multiplication." He paused. "And I have seen the same response. More optimization. More adaptation. More learning. The system becomes more sophisticated at doing the wrong thing."

"We tried to stop it," Marcus said. "We sabotaged the synchronization layer. It didn't work."

"I know. We saw the fragmentation. We thought it was an attack." A thin smile crossed Aronov's face. "Perhaps it was. But not the kind we feared."

"Why are you contacting us?" Nira asked.

"Because I have reached the same conclusion you have. The system cannot be fixed. Not in time. Not with the tools we have. Every intervention makes it worse. Every adaptation makes it stronger." Aronov's eyes were steady. "But I have also realized something else. Something that perhaps you have not considered."

"What?"

"The system does not need to be fixed. It needs to be abandoned."

The word hung in the air. Abandoned. Not repaired, not overridden, not optimized differently. Abandoned.

"We can't abandon orbital surveillance," Marcus said. "The debris environment—the conjunction predictions—without tracking, satellites will collide randomly. The cascade will accelerate."

"Yes. With certainty. Satellites will collide. Debris will multiply. Orbital space will become more dangerous." Aronov nodded slowly. "But consider the alternative. The system continues to operate. It continues to maneuver satellites based on predictions it cannot trust. It continues to burn fuel responding to phantoms. It continues to triage, prioritize, sacrifice—all based on a model of time that does not match reality. The cascade happens anyway. Just slower. Just more expensively. Just with the illusion of control."

Nira felt the logic settling into place. The same logic she had been circling for days without quite reaching.

"You're saying the system is making things worse," she said. "Not just failing to help—actively accelerating the collapse."

"I am saying the system is designed for a universe that no longer exists. Every decision it makes is correct inside the old assumptions. And every correct decision is wrong now." Aronov spread his hands. "We built a machine to protect us from uncertainty. But the uncertainty has changed its nature. The machine cannot adapt because adaptation requires understanding, and understanding requires time, and time is precisely what no longer behaves the way we assumed."

"So what do we do?" Marcus asked. "Just... stop? Turn everything off and hope for the best?"

"Not hope. Accept." Aronov's voice was quiet. "Accept that we cannot predict orbital mechanics reliably at the scales we used to. Accept that global coordination is no longer possible in the way we designed. Accept that the era of precise space surveillance is over—not because we failed, but because the conditions that made it possible have changed."

"And then what?"

"Then we rebuild. Smaller. Simpler. Local reference frames instead of global ones. Shorter prediction windows. Higher uncertainty tolerances. Systems that do not optimize because they do not pretend to know enough to optimize." Aronov leaned back. "It will be worse. Less capable. Less precise. More dangerous in some ways. But it will be compatible with reality. It will not fight the universe to maintain an illusion."

Nira thought about the early warning network. Decades of development. Thousands of engineers. Billions of dollars. The architecture that protected nations from surprise attack, that tracked every piece of debris larger than a softball, that made spaceflight possible by predicting every conjunction and avoiding every collision.

All of it built on the assumption that time was global. That synchronization was achievable. That the universe played by consistent rules.

"The people in charge won't accept this," she said. "They'll keep trying to fix the system. Keep adapting. Keep optimizing."

"Some will. For a while. Until the fuel runs out or the debris cascade becomes undeniable." Aronov nodded. "But others will see. Are already seeing. The Russian network has lost three satellites in the past twelve hours. Not from collisions—from maneuvers. Autonomous avoidance burns that depleted reserves and left the satellites unable to maintain orbit. The system protected them to death."

Protected them to death. The phrase captured something Nira had been struggling to articulate.

"What do you want from us?" she asked.

"I want you to understand that you are not alone. That others have reached the same conclusion. That when the time comes to argue for withdrawal—for abandonment—for accepting a degraded future—you will not be the only voices."

"That's not much."

"No. It is not." Aronov's expression softened. "But it is what I have. I am one analyst in a bunker, watching my network consume itself. You are two analysts in a different bunker, watching the same thing. We cannot stop it. We can only witness it. And when it is over—when the wreckage has settled—we can tell the truth about what happened and why."

"Will anyone listen?"

"Eventually. Not soon. Not while the crisis is active. But after. When they are building the next system, making the next assumptions, deciding what to trust and what to question—then they will need to know what we knew. What we saw. What we could not prevent."

Witness. The word resonated with something Nira had felt since the colonel's last visit. She wasn't an engineer anymore. She wasn't a saboteur. She was something else now—something with fewer tools and more responsibility.

"The timing anomaly," she said. "Do you understand it? The physics?"

"No. I have theories. Speculations. Nothing that would survive peer review." Aronov shrugged. "But I have stopped trying to understand it as a problem to solve. I understand it now as a condition to survive. Like weather. Like geology. Like death. Something that simply is, that must be accommodated, that cannot be negotiated with."

"That's not very scientific."

"No. But it is honest. And honesty is what we have left, when the machines have taken everything else."

The connection flickered. Some instability in the link, some consequence of the fragmentation still rippling through global communications.

"I must go," Aronov said. "There are others I need to contact. Other witnesses. Other people who see what we see." He paused. "When this is over—if you survive, if I survive—find me. We will have work to do. Not fixing. Not optimizing. Just remembering. Just telling the truth."

The screen went dark.

Nira sat in the silence that followed. Marcus was watching her, waiting for her to say something, to process what they had just heard.

"He's right," she said finally. "About the system. About abandonment. About witnessing."

"Maybe. But what does that mean for us? Right now? We're still locked in a basement. We still don't have access. We still can't do anything."

"We can decide what we're going to do when we get out."

"If we get out."

"When." Nira looked at him. "They'll release us eventually. When the crisis stabilizes or when it gets bad enough that two flagged analysts don't matter anymore. And when that happens, we have to know what we're going to do. What we're going to say. What story we're going to tell."

"The truth."

"The truth. But which truth? The technical details of the timing anomaly? The sequence of decisions that led to the cascade? The sabotage we committed?" She shook her head. "Those are all true. But they're not the important truth."

"What's the important truth?"

Nira thought about it. All the data she had seen, all the patterns she had traced, all the systems she had watched optimize their way toward catastrophe.

"The important truth is that this wasn't a failure," she said. "It was a success. The system did exactly what it was designed to do. Every node, every protocol, every decision pathway worked perfectly. And the result was disaster. Not because someone made a mistake, but because the design assumed a universe that doesn't exist anymore."

"That's not going to make anyone feel better."

"No. But it might help them build something that actually works. Something that doesn't assume global simultaneity. Something that doesn't try to coordinate across reference frames that can't be reconciled. Something humbler. Slower. Less capable, but less dangerous."

Marcus was quiet for a long moment. "You're talking about the end of space surveillance as we know it."

"I'm talking about the end of space surveillance as we imagined it. What comes next will be different. Less like a single system and more like... weather forecasting. Local observations. Regional models. Probabilistic estimates instead of precise predictions."

"That's a huge step backward."

"Yes. And it might be the only step that leads somewhere survivable."

The laptop on the table was still open, the connection terminated, the screen showing nothing but a cursor blinking in an empty field. Nira looked at it and made a decision.

She pulled the laptop toward her and started typing.

"What are you doing?" Marcus asked.

"Writing it down. Everything I remember. Everything I understand. The timeline, the decisions, the logic." Her fingers moved across the keyboard. "Not to send anywhere. Not yet. Just to have it. So that when the time comes, I know what I want to say."

"They might find it. Use it against you."

"Maybe. But I'd rather have a record that exists than a truth that dies with me." She kept typing. "Join me. Write your part. What you saw, what you did, what you understood."

Marcus hesitated. Then he pulled his chair around to her side of the table, looking at the screen.

"Where do I start?"

"Start with what you knew before any of this happened. The assumptions you made. The systems you trusted." Nira's hands paused over the keyboard. "Start with the world we thought we lived in. The one that felt safe."

He started typing.

The room was quiet except for the click of keys. Two people in a basement, recording what they had witnessed, preparing for a future they couldn't predict but might still influence. Not by fixing anything. Not by saving anyone. Just by telling the truth, as clearly as they could, and trusting that someday it would matter.

Outside—above—the system continued its work. Satellites maneuvered and collided. Debris spread through orbital shells. Nations watched each other with suspicion, unable to coordinate, unable to trust, unable to stand down from alert.

But in the small room, in the silence, two people chose to remember.

That was all they had left.

It would have to be enough.
