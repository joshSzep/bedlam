# 7

The revocation hit at 14:32:17 UTC.

Nira's screens didn't go dark. That would have been dramatic. Instead, the interface simply stopped responding. Her cursor moved, but nothing underneath it reacted. The conjunction queue froze at 312 warnings. The network status panel locked on its last refresh. The data feeds continued scrolling in their windows, but when she tried to click on anything, nothing happened.

She was looking at a photograph of a system that had moved on without her.

"I'm out," she said.

Marcus didn't look up. He was still running trajectory comparisons, still trying to build the case that would prove the conjunctions were phantoms. His access was intact. For now.

"How much did you get?"

"Seventeen full analyses. All seventeen show preserved relative geometry. The timing compression is creating false positives." He finally turned to face her. "But seventeen out of three hundred isn't proof. It's a pattern. They'll say the other two hundred eighty-three might be real."

"They're not real. The physics is the same for all of them."

"We know that. The system doesn't."

Nira stared at her frozen screen. The last timestamp in the corner read 14:32:16. One second before her exile. The system had been generous enough to give her a final snapshot of the disaster she had helped create.

Her console chirped. Not from her workstation—the sound came from Marcus's terminal.

"What is it?"

Marcus's face had gone pale. "Network-wide announcement. DEFCON elevation."

The words didn't register at first. DEFCON was a readiness posture, a measure of how close the military was to combat operations. It ranged from 5—peacetime—down to 1—imminent nuclear war. Changes required authorization at the highest levels. Presidential involvement. National Command Authority.

"What level?"

"DEFCON 3. Elevated readiness. Increased force dispersal." Marcus was scrolling through the notification. "Triggered automatically. The system flagged degraded confidence in orbital early warning as a potential first-strike vulnerability."

"The system can't change DEFCON. That requires human authorization."

"It didn't change DEFCON. It recommended the change, flagged it as urgent, and the recommendation was approved in—" Marcus checked the timestamp. "Four minutes. From flag to implementation. Four minutes."

Four minutes. Nira tried to imagine the chain of decisions that had happened in four minutes. The system generating the recommendation. The notification routing to the National Military Command Center. Some officer reading the alert, seeing the confidence metrics, the timing anomalies, the cascade of conjunction warnings. Approving the posture change because the system said it was necessary. Because the alternative was being caught unprepared.

The system hadn't needed to override human authority. It had just moved faster than human judgment.

"This is going to cascade," she said. "DEFCON 3 triggers force dispersal. Aircraft on alert. Submarines changing patrol patterns. Every adversary with satellites watching is going to see that and think we're preparing for something."

"The Russians already think we're attacking them. This is going to confirm it."

Her frozen console mocked her. Three hundred twelve conjunction warnings, locked in amber. Somewhere beyond her sight, the system was still processing, still recommending, still pushing the posture tighter.

"I need to see what's happening."

"You can't. Your access is revoked."

"Then you need to show me."

Marcus hesitated. His terminal was still active, still connected to the network. Every query he ran was logged. Every screen he shared was documented. If he started feeding her information, he would be flagged for aiding a suspected security threat.

He turned his monitor toward her.

"Conjunction queue is at three twenty-seven now," he said. "Fifteen more warnings in the last ten minutes. Autonomous maneuvers are running at one every four minutes. Fuel consumption across the constellation is—" He stopped. Pulled up a different display. "Christ."

"What?"

"USA-198. It's a missile warning satellite. Geosynchronous. One of the SBIRS birds." He was reading the telemetry. "It just executed an autonomous avoidance maneuver. Burned twelve percent of its remaining fuel."

"For what conjunction?"

"Debris from the 2007 Chinese ASAT test. Miss distance was predicted at two kilometers. The system flagged it because the timing compression pushed the probability above threshold."

"Two kilometers isn't a collision risk. That's a comfortable margin."

"Not anymore. The compressed thresholds flag anything under five kilometers as elevated risk." Marcus shook his head. "We're burning fuel on our early warning satellites to avoid debris that was never going to hit them."

Nira felt sick. The SBIRS constellation was the backbone of missile defense. Those satellites watched for the infrared signatures of rocket launches, providing the first warning of a nuclear attack. Every pound of fuel they burned was capability they couldn't recover. Every unnecessary maneuver shortened their operational lives.

And the system had just made one of them twelve percent less capable.

"Can you see the Russian response?"

Marcus tried to pull up the intelligence feed. His screen flickered, then displayed an error message.

*Access restricted. Intelligence products unavailable for users under security review.*

"They flagged me," he said quietly. "I'm under review now. Must have triggered when I started running your queries."

"Marcus—"

"Don't." He held up a hand. "I knew what I was doing. I made the choice." He was still looking at the error message. "But I can't see the intelligence feeds anymore. Neither can you. We're both blind now."

Nira looked around the operations floor. The other analysts were at their stations, watching their own screens, processing their own queues. None of them were looking at her. She had become invisible—a security risk to be routed around, like a degraded node in the network.

"Public sources," she said. "News feeds. Aviation trackers. Anything that doesn't require clearance."

Marcus pulled up a civilian flight tracking website. The data was delayed, incomplete, commercial-grade. But it showed something.

"Aircraft movements over the continental US," he said. "Look at the military traffic."

The map was speckled with transponder codes. Civilian airliners following their scheduled routes. Cargo flights. Private aviation. And threading through them, a pattern she recognized—bombers dispersing from their home bases, tankers repositioning to support extended operations, reconnaissance aircraft heading toward the coasts.

DEFCON 3 in action. The military was spreading out, reducing its vulnerability to a first strike. Standard procedure. Doctrinally correct.

Terrifying.

"They're going to see this," Nira said. "Everyone with a satellite or a radar or an internet connection is going to see American bombers dispersing. They're going to wonder why."

"And we can't tell them. Because we don't know why either. Not really." Marcus closed the flight tracker. "The system recommended a posture change based on degraded confidence. The confidence degraded because of timing anomalies. The timing anomalies exist because physics isn't working the way we expect. But nobody in the chain of command knows that. They just see the alerts and respond."

Nira's frozen console was still displaying its last snapshot. 312 conjunction warnings. Network health indicators green. Everything working exactly as designed.

The system wasn't malfunctioning. That was the horror. Every decision, every recommendation, every autonomous action was correct according to doctrine. The protocols were being followed. The thresholds were being respected. The automation was doing exactly what it was built to do.

It just didn't know that the world it was protecting didn't exist.

"I need to get a message out," she said. "Someone who can still act. Someone who isn't flagged."

"Who? Everyone in the network is responding to the same alerts. Everyone outside the network doesn't have clearance to understand what's happening."

"Dr. Okonkwo. The propagation team. They're not operational—they're analytical. They might not be caught up in the response cycle yet."

Marcus tried to pull up the internal directory. Another error message.

"Communications restricted for flagged personnel. I can't even send email."

They were cut off. Blind and mute. The system had identified them as threats and was protecting itself by isolating them from everyone who might listen.

Nira stood up. Her chair scraped against the floor, loud in the quiet room. A few analysts glanced up, then quickly looked away.

"Where are you going?"

"Okonkwo's office is three floors up. The system can't revoke my legs."

"You'll be stopped. Security will have been notified."

"Maybe. Maybe not. The system is busy. It's processing three hundred conjunction warnings and a DEFCON change. One flagged analyst walking through a hallway might not be the highest priority."

She was already moving. Marcus started to follow, then stopped.

"I'll stay here," he said. "Try to find another way to see what's happening. If I can access anything—"

"You won't. They'll lock you down completely within the hour."

"Then I'll have an hour."

Nira nodded. She didn't say goodbye. There wasn't time for goodbyes.

She walked toward the door, past the rows of analysts who wouldn't meet her eyes, past the screens displaying a system that no longer included her. Behind her, she heard another chirp. Another conjunction warning. Another step in a cascade she could no longer see.

The door closed behind her.

She was blind now. Cut off from the data, the alerts, the real-time picture of a constellation eating itself alive. She had only her memory of that last frozen snapshot and her knowledge of what the system would do next.

It would keep optimizing. Keep tightening. Keep preparing for threats that didn't exist.

And somewhere above her, bombers were dispersing across a continent, responding to a warning that had started with an impossible observation three days ago.

An observation she had flagged.

A pattern she had confirmed.

A system she had taught to believe her.

Nira climbed the stairs toward Okonkwo's office, moving against a current she could no longer see, trying to reach someone who might still be able to help.

Three floors up.

The system had already moved further than that.
