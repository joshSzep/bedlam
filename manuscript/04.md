# 4

The GEO data came in two hours early.

Nira was mid-coffee when her console lit up with priority traffic from the Space Based Infrared System. SBIRS didn't wait for scheduled tracking passes. It watched in real time. And right now, it was watching a geosynchronous communications satellite drift out of its station-keeping box.

"Marcus."

He was already moving. The SBIRS feed showed Galaxy 37, a commercial broadcast satellite parked over the mid-Atlantic, registering position errors that exceeded its operational tolerance. The satellite wasn't where it should be. Or rather—it was where it should be, but the prediction said it shouldn't be there yet.

Seven point eight seconds early.

"That's not possible," Marcus said. "GEO birds don't drift. They're station-kept. Ground controllers correct their positions daily."

"The position is correct. The timing is wrong."

"By almost eight seconds?" He pulled up the orbital elements. "At GEO altitude, that's—"

"Two hundred forty kilometers of along-track error. If this were a real position discrepancy, the satellite would be in the wrong orbital slot entirely."

But it wasn't in the wrong slot. Nira could see the telemetry from the satellite's own onboard systems. Galaxy 37 knew exactly where it was. Its GPS receiver agreed with its star trackers agreed with its ground controllers. The satellite was precisely where it belonged.

It had just gotten there too soon.

Her console chirped again. Another GEO satellite showing early arrival. Then another. Then three more in rapid succession.

"The whole belt," Marcus said. "It's the whole goddamn belt."

Nira watched the alerts cascade. Commercial communications satellites. Military MILSTAR birds. Weather platforms. Navigation payloads. Early-warning sensors. Everything at geostationary altitude was reporting the same impossible signature—position nominal, timing anomalous, discrepancy scaling exactly as the altitude regression predicted.

The system was ingesting it all.

She pulled up the network status panel. The model weights were updating in real time, adjusting for seven, eight, nine seconds of early arrival at GEO. The response thresholds were compressing to match. Conjunction predictions across the entire catalog were shifting, tightening, accelerating.

"We need to stop the updates," she said.

"We can't. Chen hasn't authorized a pause."

"Then get him on the line. Now."

Marcus was reaching for his console when the priority channel opened on its own. Colonel Chen's face appeared on the screen, and Nira knew immediately that something had changed. His expression wasn't unreadable anymore. It was barely controlled.

"Chandrasekaran. Reyes. We have a problem."

"We're seeing the GEO data," Nira said. "The pattern holds. Eight-second discrepancies across—"

"I know about the GEO data. That's not the problem." Chen's jaw tightened. "NORAD just received an automated threat assessment from the Russian early-warning network. They're seeing the same timing anomalies we are. And they're interpreting them differently."

Nira's stomach dropped. "Interpreting them how?"

"They think we're spoofing their sensors. They think the timing discrepancies are deliberate interference designed to degrade their tracking confidence."

"That's insane. The anomaly is global. We're seeing it too."

"They know that. They think we're seeing our own spoofing operation reflected back through their systems." Chen's voice was flat. "From their perspective, the pattern is exactly what a sophisticated timing attack would look like. Correlated errors across multiple systems. Scaling with distance from ground stations. Degrading confidence in orbital predictions."

"But it's not an attack. It's physics."

"We can't prove that. We can't even explain it." Chen leaned closer to the camera. "The Russian network is switching to heightened alert status. They're activating backup tracking systems and cross-checking against their own atomic standards. They're treating this as a potential first-strike indicator."

The words hung in the air. First-strike indicator. The signature that preceded a nuclear attack. The pattern that early-warning systems were designed to detect above all else.

"Sir, our system is doing the same thing," Marcus said. "The model updates are compressing response thresholds. If both networks are tightening at the same time—"

"Then neither side can afford to be the one that relaxes first." Chen nodded grimly. "We're in a confidence spiral. The less we trust our predictions, the faster we react. The faster we react, the less the other side trusts our intentions. The less they trust us, the faster they react."

Nira thought about the data-sharing protocol. The queries propagating across networks. The confirmations feeding back into model updates. She had triggered this cascade by flagging an anomaly. Now the cascade was feeding on itself.

"Can we share our analysis with them?" she asked. "Show them the altitude correlation? Prove that this isn't targeted interference?"

"We're trying. But diplomatic channels move slower than automated systems. By the time we get a physicist on a call with their counterparts, both networks will have updated their models three more times."

Another alert chirped on Nira's console. She checked it automatically, then froze.

"Colonel. We just received a maneuver warning."

"What kind of maneuver?"

"Collision avoidance. Automated. The system is recommending a burn for USA-314."

USA-314. Nira pulled up the orbital data. A classified reconnaissance satellite in low Earth orbit. One of the crown jewels of the national intelligence architecture.

"The conjunction probability is above threshold," she said. "The system is predicting a close approach with a debris fragment in six hours. It's recommending a four-meter-per-second burn to increase miss distance."

"What was the probability before the model update?"

She ran the calculation. "Point zero three percent. Well below the maneuver threshold."

"And now?"

"Two point seven percent. The timing compression pushed it over."

Marcus was shaking his head. "That burn will cost fuel. USA-314 has limited delta-v. If we maneuver every time the model predicts a close approach—"

"We'll burn through the constellation's reserves in weeks," Chen finished. "I know. But if we don't maneuver and the conjunction is real—"

"Then we lose a billion-dollar asset and create a debris field that threatens everything else in that orbital regime."

The choice was impossible. Trust the model and spend irreplaceable resources. Distrust the model and risk catastrophic loss.

And the model was based on a phenomenon no one understood.

"Deny the maneuver," Chen said. "Override the recommendation. I'll take responsibility."

"Sir, if the conjunction is real—"

"It's not. The probability jumped because of the timing compression, not because the debris moved. The physical geometry hasn't changed. Only our prediction of when the objects will reach that geometry." Chen's voice hardened. "Override the recommendation. Log my authorization. And pray to God I'm right."

Nira entered the override. The system acknowledged it, flagged the denial, logged the authorization code. The maneuver recommendation disappeared from the queue.

But the model didn't change. The system still believed objects were arriving early. It would generate more recommendations. More conjunctions above threshold. More impossible choices between burning fuel and accepting risk.

"How many assets do we have in orbit?" she asked quietly.

Marcus checked. "Active US military and intelligence satellites? Four hundred twelve. Commercial birds we're responsible for tracking? Another three thousand."

"And how many conjunction predictions in the next twenty-four hours?"

He ran the query. His face went pale.

"Two hundred thirty-seven. Up from forty-one yesterday."

The timing compression had multiplied the threat surface by a factor of six. Two hundred thirty-seven potential collisions that the old model wouldn't have flagged. Two hundred thirty-seven decisions to make—maneuver or hold, trust or doubt, spend or risk.

And somewhere in Moscow, the Russian network was facing the same math. The same impossible choices. The same pressure to act before understanding.

"Colonel," Nira said, "we need to pause the model updates. Now. Before the conjunction queue gets any longer."

Chen's expression flickered—frustration, fear, calculation. "If we pause our model and theirs keeps updating, we fall behind. Our predictions diverge from reality. We miss real threats."

"If we don't pause, we'll have to make two hundred decisions in twenty-four hours with no confidence in any of them. The system will force us to act faster than we can think."

"The system is designed to act faster than we can think. That's the point."

"The system is designed for known failure modes. This isn't known. This is—" Nira stopped. She didn't have a word for what this was.

Chen was silent for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was quieter.

"I'll request authorization to pause learning. But it has to go up the chain. STRATCOM. Maybe higher. That takes time we don't have."

"How much time?"

"Hours. Maybe longer."

Nira looked at her console. The conjunction queue was still growing. The model weights were still updating. The confidence thresholds were still compressing.

Hours. In hours, the system would make a hundred decisions without them.

"We'll keep monitoring," she said. It was all she could say.

Chen nodded and cut the connection.

Marcus leaned back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. "The Russians think we're attacking them. We think physics is broken. Both systems are tightening into combat posture. And nobody has the authority to hit the brakes."

Nira didn't respond. She was watching the conjunction queue tick upward.

Two hundred thirty-nine.

Two hundred forty-one.

Two hundred forty-three.

The system was still learning. Still optimizing. Still preparing for a war that might not exist against threats that might not be real.

And somewhere above them, four hundred satellites were waiting for orders that nobody knew how to give.
