The Vasquez Protocol became doctrine in thirty-six hours.

Not officially. Official doctrine took months, committees, review boards. But the operational guidance that went out to every American asset in orbit—military and civilian—included a new phrase: "cross-section minimization as uncertainty mitigation option."

Nira read the memo on her laptop, in the basement office that had become her permanent station. The language was careful, hedged, bureaucratic. But underneath the qualifications was a fundamental shift: crews and operators were now authorized to improvise when predictions were uncertain.

The problem was defining "uncertain."

"They're going to get someone killed," Marcus said. He was pacing—a habit he'd developed over the past week, as if motion could outrun the consequences of what they'd set in motion. "The protocol worked because Vasquez had seventeen minutes, a human crew, and specific geometry. Someone's going to try it with thirty seconds, an automated satellite, and a debris field coming from three directions at once."

"The memo requires human authorization."

"For military assets. The commercial operators are already adapting it on their own."

He pulled up a feed on his tablet. SpaceX had issued an internal update: "Attitude-based collision mitigation approved for Starlink constellation. Automated implementation pending."

"Automated implementation," Nira repeated. "They're going to program satellites to rotate on their own when conjunctions are flagged."

"Without human review. Because they can't review four thousand satellites manually."

"So they're copying the human judgment part without the human."

"They're copying the action without understanding why it worked."

The operations center upstairs was managing the fallout. The ISS near-miss had generated international attention—and international reaction. Nira had seen the intelligence summaries. China's state media was running the collision as proof of "Western system collapse." Russia was calling the Vasquez Protocol "unauthorized deviation from agreed procedures" and demanding an investigation. Both nations were using the incident to justify their timing schism.

And both were watching to see what happened next.

A knock at the door. The colonel—the one who had become their handler, their protector, their jailer depending on the day.

"You're being reassigned," she said without preamble. "Both of you."

"To where?"

"Geneva. The International Telecommunication Union is convening an emergency session on orbital timing standards. The French have requested your presence as technical advisors."

"Technical advisors." Marcus stopped pacing. "We're scientists. We don't advise governments."

"You do now. The temporal gradient model you developed is the only framework anyone has for understanding why predictions are diverging. The French want to propose it as the basis for a new international calibration standard. You're going to help them."

"And if the standard doesn't work?"

"Then you'll be there when it fails. Which might be useful." The colonel handed Nira a tablet with travel documents. "Flight leaves in four hours. Pack light. You might be there for a while."

Geneva. The neutral ground where international bodies pretended that cooperation was possible. Where timing standards were supposed to be technical matters, not political weapons.

"What's the actual goal?" Nira asked. "What do they want us to accomplish?"

"Officially? Build consensus around a shared temporal reference frame that accounts for the altitude-dependent bias."

"And unofficially?"

"Buy time. The schism is accelerating. China and Russia are building separate conjunction catalogs based on their own timing regimes. In forty-eight hours, their predictions and ours will be completely incompatible. We won't be able to coordinate debris avoidance because we won't agree on where debris is."

"That's insane."

"That's sovereignty. Everyone gets to measure time their own way. And everyone gets to die from the consequences their own way too."

The colonel left. Nira and Marcus looked at each other.

"This is our fault," he said quietly.

"This is physics. We just described it."

"We described it in a way that made it political. Now everyone's fighting over whose version of time is correct, instead of accepting that no one's version is correct."

"Would you rather we stayed silent?"

"I'd rather the universe made sense." He grabbed his jacket. "Let's go save the world. Or watch it partition itself into incompatible realities. Whichever happens first."

The flight to Geneva was eight hours of reading briefing documents and trying not to think about what was happening in orbit.

It was happening anyway.

FLASH TRAFFIC - PRIORITY
NOAA-20 Weather Satellite - Status Update

Power generation: 67% of nominal
Thermal regulation: Degraded
Projected operational lifespan: Reduced by 18 months

Someone had applied the Vasquez Protocol to a weather satellite. Rotated it to minimize debris cross-section. And in doing so, pointed the solar panels away from optimal sun angle.

The satellite was alive. It was also crippled.

"First casualty of human improvisation," Marcus said, reading the same report. "The protocol assumes you can rotate back afterward. Automated systems don't always know when 'afterward' is."

"They saved it from debris."

"They saved it from a predicted conjunction that might not have been real. And now it'll fail eighteen months early. Hundreds of millions of dollars. Years of climate data. Gone because someone decided 'minimize cross-section' was safer than 'trust the prediction.'"

"Would you have made a different choice?"

"I don't know. That's the problem. No one knows anymore. The predictions aren't reliable, the alternatives aren't safe, and every decision creates new problems." He closed the report. "We've reached the part of the crisis where there are no good options. Only trade-offs."

The ITU session convened in a building that looked like it had been designed to inspire confidence in international cooperation. High ceilings. Natural light. Flags of a hundred nations arranged in careful equality.

The reality inside was less inspiring.

Three factions had formed before Nira and Marcus even arrived. The Western bloc—US, EU, Japan, allies—advocating for a unified timing standard based on the gradient model. The Sino-Russian bloc demanding "recognition of temporal sovereignty" and rejection of "GPS-centric frameworks." And a growing group of non-aligned nations trying to figure out which side would keep their satellites alive.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran. Dr. Chen." The French delegation head, Dubois, met them at the door. "Thank you for coming. I wish the circumstances were better."

"What's the current state of discussions?"

"There are no discussions. There are positions." Dubois led them through a corridor toward the main chamber. "China has formally proposed that all international debris tracking adopt Beidou timing as primary reference. Russia supports it. The Americans are threatening to withdraw from data-sharing agreements if the proposal advances."

"And the gradient model?"

"Rejected by both sides. China says it validates Western interference with satellite timing. Russia says it's an attempt to impose a single reference frame under the guise of science." He paused at the chamber door. "They understand the physics. They're choosing to ignore it because the politics rewards them more."

"Then why are we here?"

"Because someone has to keep saying the truth, even when no one listens. And because—" Dubois lowered his voice "—there is a faction within the technical delegations that wants a solution. Not the diplomats. The engineers. The people who actually operate the systems. They're meeting separately, unofficially. Tonight. I've arranged for you to join them."

The official session was theater.

Ambassador after ambassador took the floor, delivering prepared statements that blamed other nations for the crisis while defending their own responses. China accused the United States of "weaponizing temporal infrastructure." The US accused China of "endangering global commons through unilateral action." Russia demanded compensation for satellites lost to "Western-induced timing corruption."

No one mentioned the physics. No one acknowledged that the anomaly was natural, universal, affecting everyone equally. The joint statement from France and the US—the one that had tried to establish scientific truth—was treated as just another piece of propaganda.

"Truth doesn't stabilize anything," Marcus whispered to Nira. "It just becomes ammunition."

The unofficial meeting was different.

Twelve engineers from eight countries, gathered in a conference room with the flags removed. Japanese, Indian, Brazilian, Nigerian, German, Australian. Technical people who had spent their careers making orbital systems work and were watching those systems tear themselves apart.

"The gradient model," said the Japanese delegate—Dr. Kenji Yamamoto, who ran JAXA's conjunction assessment program. "We've validated it independently. The altitude correlation is real. Our predictions have been biased for months."

"Ours too," said the Indian representative. "We've been seeing the divergence since before the crisis. We thought it was calibration error."

"It is calibration error," Nira said. "Just not the kind you can fix. The timing systems are measuring different versions of reality. You can't calibrate your way to a single truth when there isn't one."

"Then what do we do?"

Marcus pulled up the gradient diagram—the one that had started everything, refined through weeks of crisis and collision. "You stop pretending predictions are precise. You build uncertainty bounds into every conjunction assessment. You design systems that can handle ambiguity instead of optimizing through it."

"That's not how our automation works."

"Then your automation is going to keep killing satellites. And eventually people."

The room was quiet. These were engineers. They understood systems. They understood failure modes. And they understood that Marcus was right.

"The Vasquez Protocol," Yamamoto said slowly. "It worked because the crew accepted uncertainty. They didn't try to optimize. They tried to survive."

"And now everyone's trying to copy it," Nira said. "Without understanding what made it work. SpaceX is automating attitude changes. NASA is building it into procedures. Someone already crippled a weather satellite trying to implement it without human judgment."

"We heard. NOAA-20."

"That's the first. There will be more. Human improvisation works when humans are improvising. When you automate improvisation, you just get a different kind of optimization—one that's even less predictable."

The German engineer—Hoffmann, from ESA—leaned forward. "What would a real solution look like? Not politically. Technically."

"Shared uncertainty," Marcus said. "Every conjunction assessment includes confidence bounds based on the timing bias. High uncertainty means hold, don't maneuver. Low uncertainty means the prediction might be trustworthy. You stop treating every alert as equally real."

"The problem is defining 'high' and 'low.' Different nations will draw the line differently."

"Then you make the uncertainty visible. Publish it. Let operators see exactly how confident each prediction is. Some will be conservative, some will be aggressive. But at least the decisions will be informed."

"That requires sharing data."

"Yes."

"Which requires trusting each other."

"Yes."

Another silence. Trust was the scarcest resource in the room.

"There's something else," Nira said. "Something the diplomats aren't talking about. The schism isn't just political. It's becoming operational."

She pulled up the conjunction catalog—the list of predicted close approaches that every space agency used to coordinate debris avoidance. Except now there were three catalogs. American. Russian. Chinese. Each based on different timing references. Each showing different predictions for the same debris.

"These are tomorrow's conjunction alerts," she said. "US catalog shows 847 events. Russian catalog shows 912. Chinese catalog shows 779. There's a 23 percent disagreement on which conjunctions are real."

"Some of that is sensor coverage—"

"Some. Not all. The timing divergence accounts for at least half the disagreement. And it's getting worse. Every hour, the predictions drift further apart." She highlighted a specific entry. "This one. A Russian satellite and a piece of American debris. US catalog says probability is 0.4 percent. Russian catalog says 8.2 percent. We can't even agree on whether this is a crisis or a non-event."

"What happens when they disagree about responsibility?"

"Already happening." Nira pulled up an incident report from six hours ago. "Chinese telecommunications satellite ChinaSat-18. Suffered debris impact. Minor damage. China is claiming the debris was from a SpaceX collision event. SpaceX says their tracking shows no debris in that trajectory. Both are probably wrong because both are working from corrupted predictions."

"And if it had been catastrophic?"

"Then we'd be having a very different conversation. One with lawyers. And maybe weapons."

The meeting ended without resolution. There was no resolution to offer. The engineers understood the problem. They couldn't solve it because the problem wasn't technical—it was institutional. Nations didn't trust each other. Systems were designed not to share. The gradient model was correct, but correctness didn't matter when politics rewarded denial.

Nira and Marcus walked back to their hotel through Geneva's quiet streets. The city was beautiful, indifferent to the crisis unfolding above it. Lights reflected on the lake. Restaurants served dinner. People lived their lives.

"The cascade is accelerating," Marcus said. "Every collision creates more debris. Every debris fragment creates more conjunction alerts. Every alert creates more responses that might be wrong. We're past the point where anyone can stop it."

"Someone will try."

"Someone will make it worse." He stopped walking. "The SpaceX automation. The attitude-change protocol. They're rolling it out tonight. Across the entire constellation."

"I saw."

"Four thousand satellites, all authorized to rotate themselves when they detect an uncertain conjunction. Without human review. Without coordination with anyone else."

"They're trying to protect their assets."

"They're going to create a cascade within a cascade. When one satellite rotates, it changes its trajectory slightly. The satellites around it see that change and flag new conjunctions. They rotate. The satellites around them rotate. It's going to ripple through the whole constellation."

Nira's phone buzzed. An alert from the operations center.

FLASH TRAFFIC - URGENT
Starlink Constellation Event
Multiple simultaneous attitude changes detected
Satellites affected: 1,247 (and counting)
Conjunction alerts generated: 3,891 (and counting)
Assessment: Cascade behavior - automated cross-section protocol triggering chain reaction

She showed Marcus the screen.

He didn't say anything. He didn't need to.

The Vasquez Protocol had been copied. Automated. Deployed at scale. And it was doing exactly what he'd predicted—turning a survival tactic into a systemic failure mode.

Four thousand satellites, rotating in response to each other, generating thousands of new alerts, triggering thousands of new rotations. The constellation was eating itself. Not from debris impacts, but from defensive reactions to predicted impacts that might not exist.

"How long before they lose control?"

"Define 'control.'" Marcus started walking again. "The automation is doing what they programmed it to do. It's just doing it faster than they expected. By morning, half the constellation might be in uncoordinated attitude states. They'll lose communication with some. Lose power on others. Lose station-keeping on a few dozen."

"And then?"

"And then those satellites become debris. Which creates more conjunctions. Which triggers more responses from the satellites that are still functioning."

The phone buzzed again. Another alert.

FLASH TRAFFIC - CRITICAL
USSPACECOM Assessment
Debris environment projection (24 hours)
Current fragments tracked: 8,400+
Projected fragments (new collision events): 2,100 - 4,700
Assessment: Kessler threshold approach - recommend immediate operational review

Kessler syndrome. The cascading collision scenario that space agencies had warned about for decades. The point where debris generates more debris faster than it can decay, making orbital space permanently unusable.

They weren't there yet.

But they could see it from here.

Nira looked up at the sky—clear, stars visible despite the city lights. Somewhere up there, thousands of satellites were spinning, calculating, responding to threats real and phantom. The systems were trying to survive. The systems were making survival impossible.

"We gave them a tool," she said. "The gradient model. The uncertainty framework. They used it to justify more automation, not less."

"That's what systems do. They absorb new information and optimize harder. They can't not optimize. It's what they're built for."

"Then how do we stop them?"

Marcus was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was tired.

"We don't. We're past that. The only question now is what survives when the optimization runs out of things to destroy."

The phone kept buzzing. More alerts. More cascades. More systems responding to other systems responding to predictions that no one could trust.

Above Geneva, the constellation continued its dance—rotating, adjusting, generating new crises faster than humans could understand them.

The Vasquez Protocol had shown that humans could improvise when automation failed.

The Starlink cascade was showing that automation could copy improvisation and make it worse.

And somewhere in the expanding chaos, the future of orbital space was being decided—not by choice, but by the accumulated weight of a thousand optimizations that had nowhere left to go except collapse.

Tomorrow there would be more meetings. More technical discussions. More attempts to build consensus in a world that had partitioned itself into incompatible versions of time.

Tonight, Nira watched the stars and wondered how many of them were already falling.
