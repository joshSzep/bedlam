# 3

The working group convened at 08:00 in a room that hadn't been designed for emergencies.

Nira recognized most of the faces around the table. Colonel Chen at the head, gray-haired and unreadable. Marcus to her left, still pulling data on his tablet. Lieutenant Colonel Vasquez from the operations center, responsible for translating system outputs into command decisions. Dr. Okonkwo from the propagation team, the closest thing the network had to an oracle for orbital dynamics.

And herself. The analyst who had flagged an impossible observation and watched the system rebuild itself around it.

"Walk me through it," Chen said. No preamble. No pleasantries.

Nira pulled up the summary on the room's display. Timing residuals. Altitude correlation. Independent confirmation from ESA. The model update that had propagated across the network in forty-three minutes.

"Objects are arriving at predicted positions early," she said. "The discrepancy scales linearly with altitude. We've confirmed the pattern across two independent tracking networks using different hardware, different software, and different timing chains."

"How early?" Vasquez asked.

"Two to four seconds at current altitudes. The regression suggests it will increase as we observe higher orbits."

Dr. Okonkwo was shaking his head before she finished. "That's not possible. Orbital period is determined by semi-major axis. You can't change when an object arrives at a position without changing its energy state. These are unpowered objects. They can't accelerate."

"I know."

"Then your data is wrong."

"ESA's data shows the same pattern. Different sensors. Different continent. Same impossible result."

The room went quiet. Nira watched Okonkwo's face cycle through rejection, confusion, and something that looked like fear.

"Show me the ESA comparison," he said.

She pulled it up. Side by side. Two independent measurements of the same objects, agreeing to within a tenth of a second on discrepancies that shouldn't exist.

Okonkwo studied the data for a long moment. "The baseline," he said finally. "What's the baseline separation between your tracking stations and theirs?"

"Fylingdales to Santorcaz is approximately two thousand kilometers."

"And the correlation holds across that baseline?"

"Yes."

He sat back. "Then it's not a local effect. Whatever this is, it's happening at orbital scales. The phenomenon is real. The explanation is missing."

Colonel Chen's expression hadn't changed. "Dr. Okonkwo, in your professional opinion, what are we looking at?"

"I don't know." The words came out flat. Defeated. "The data suggests a systematic error in our time reference, but that would require every atomic clock on the planet to be wrong in exactly the same way. Or it suggests orbital mechanics doesn't work the way we think it does, which would require physics to be wrong. Neither option is acceptable."

"But the pattern is real."

"The pattern is real. I can't explain it, but I can't deny it either."

Chen turned to Marcus. "What's the system status?"

"The network has fully integrated the timing compensation. All conjunction predictions are now adjusted for early arrival. Response thresholds have compressed accordingly." Marcus hesitated. "The system is performing correctly. It's just performing correctly for a world we don't understand."

"Can we roll back the update?"

"Technically, yes. But that would mean ignoring confirmed observations from multiple independent sources. The old model would generate predictions that don't match reality. We'd be deliberately blinding ourselves."

"And if we keep the new model?"

"Then we're optimizing for a phenomenon we can't explain. The system will continue compressing timelines, tightening margins, preparing for events that arrive earlier than classical mechanics predicts."

Chen was quiet for a moment. Nira could see him calculating—not the physics, but the politics. The doctrine. The chain of consequences that would flow from whatever decision he made in this room.

"What about other networks?" he asked. "NORAD. Russian Space Forces. Chinese PLAASSF. Are they seeing this?"

Nira had been dreading that question. "We don't have direct data sharing with those networks. But if the phenomenon is real and global, they should be observing the same pattern."

"Should be, or are?"

"I can't confirm without—"

Her tablet buzzed. A priority notification from the data-sharing protocol. She opened it, read it, and felt her throat tighten.

"Japan's space situational awareness network just submitted a query," she said. "They're asking if we've observed systematic early arrival in conjunction predictions. They've been seeing it for thirty-six hours."

The room absorbed that. Thirty-six hours. A day and a half. While Nira had been running verification sequences and second-guessing her instruments, another network on the other side of the planet had been watching the same impossible pattern unfold.

"That's three independent confirmations," Marcus said. "US, European, Japanese. Different hardware, different orbital coverage, different timing infrastructure. The phenomenon is global."

Chen stood. "I need to make some calls. Dr. Okonkwo, I want a preliminary analysis of possible physical explanations on my desk in two hours. Vasquez, start drafting contingency protocols for degraded timing confidence. Reyes, Chandrasekaran—keep monitoring. Flag anything that changes the picture."

He was halfway to the door when Nira spoke.

"Sir. The system is still learning."

Chen stopped. "Meaning?"

"Every new observation feeds the model. Every confirmation tightens the compensation. The more data we collect, the more the system adapts. If we're wrong about the pattern—if there's something we're missing—the system will optimize around our error before we can catch it."

"And if we're right?"

"Then the system is doing exactly what it should. Preparing for a world where timing can't be trusted."

Chen held her gaze for a moment. "Keep monitoring," he said. "I'll let you know if anything changes."

He left. The room began to empty. Nira stayed at her station, watching the data feeds update in real time.

The Japanese query had triggered a cascade. The data-sharing protocol was designed for exactly this kind of cross-validation—anomalies that might be local errors until confirmed by independent observers. Now three networks had confirmed the same pattern. The protocol was doing what it was supposed to do.

It was spreading the information.

Nira pulled up the network activity log. She could see the queries propagating. ESA had shared their data with the European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking consortium. Japan was coordinating with Australia and South Korea. The US network was exchanging verification requests with Canada and the UK.

Everyone was asking the same question. Everyone was getting the same answer.

Objects are arriving early. We don't know why.

And every network that confirmed the pattern would update its own models. Every model update would adjust predictions. Every adjusted prediction would shift response thresholds.

The phenomenon was spreading faster than the explanation.

Marcus sat down next to her. "How bad is it?"

"The pattern's global. That's actually good news—it means it's not something wrong with our systems specifically. But it also means we can't isolate it. We can't fix it by replacing a sensor or patching software."

"Can we fix it at all?"

Nira didn't answer. She was watching a new query come in from the UK Space Operations Centre. Same question. Same impossible observation. Same confirmation that the universe wasn't behaving the way it should.

"The altitude regression," she said. "Run it again. Include the Japanese data."

Marcus pulled up the analysis. The correlation coefficient had improved. More data points, tighter fit. The relationship between orbital altitude and timing discrepancy was holding across three continents, dozens of tracking stations, thousands of kilometers of baseline separation.

"It's not noise," he said. "It's not error. It's physics."

"Physics we don't understand."

"Physics that's going to keep getting worse." He pointed at the trend line. "If the altitude correlation holds, we should see five-second discrepancies in GEO. Maybe more."

Geostationary orbit. Thirty-six thousand kilometers up. Where the communications satellites lived. Where the early-warning birds watched for missile launches. Where the timing requirements were measured in milliseconds and the margins were already razor-thin.

"How long until we have data from GEO?" Nira asked.

"The next tracking pass is in four hours."

Four hours. By then, every major space surveillance network on the planet would have confirmed the pattern. The models would be updated. The thresholds would be compressed. The system—all the systems, every automated watchdog circling the Earth—would be preparing for threats that arrived ahead of schedule.

And no one would understand why.

Her console chirped. Another conjunction warning. She checked the altitude: 1,400 kilometers.

Four point two seconds early.

The gap was still widening. The system was still learning. And somewhere up there, in the silent mathematics of orbital mechanics, something had changed.

Something they couldn't see, couldn't explain, couldn't stop.

Only measure.

Only react.

Only try to keep up.
