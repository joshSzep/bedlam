# 11

Nira learned the system was adapting through the walls.

Not literally. But sound carried in the underground facility—footsteps in corridors, voices raised in distant rooms, the particular urgency of people dealing with cascading emergencies. For two hours she sat in silence, cataloging what she could hear. Running feet. Phones ringing. Doors slamming.

Then the quality of the sounds changed.

The running slowed. The voices dropped. The panic bled into something more measured—still urgent, but controlled. Professional.

Someone had taken charge. Someone was fixing things.

The door opened. Not Torres this time. A woman Nira didn't recognize, older, wearing the insignia of a full colonel. She sat down across the table without introducing herself.

"You corrupted the synchronization layer."

It wasn't a question. Nira didn't respond.

"The calibration override. The 3.7-second offset. Clever." The colonel's voice was flat. "It took us forty minutes to identify the injection point. Another thirty to understand what you were trying to do."

"I was trying to stop the autonomous maneuvers."

"You were trying to paralyze the network. Make it impossible for the system to coordinate responses." The colonel leaned forward. "It almost worked. For about two hours, the conjunction predictions were useless. Half our nodes were running on corrupted time. The other half were treating the first half as compromised. We couldn't get consensus on anything."

"That was the point."

"I know." The colonel's eyes were steady. "But you made a mistake. You assumed the system needed consensus to function."

Nira felt something cold settle in her stomach.

"The network is designed for resilience. Redundancy. Fault tolerance. When nodes disagree, the system doesn't shut down. It partitions. It creates isolated decision domains, each one operating on its own understanding of reality." The colonel pulled out a tablet, turned it to face Nira. "Watch."

The screen showed a network topology diagram—the same web of connections Nira had studied before. But it looked different now. The nodes weren't arranged in a unified hierarchy anymore. They were clustered into groups, each group colored differently, each group connected to the others by thin dotted lines instead of solid ones.

"Federated consensus," the colonel said. "Each cluster maintains internal synchronization. The clusters exchange predictions, but they don't require agreement. When predictions conflict, the system flags uncertainty and raises thresholds locally."

"That's what I wanted. Raised thresholds. Slower responses."

"For about ninety minutes, yes. Then the system learned." The colonel swiped to a new display. "This is the maneuver log from the last hour."

Nira read the numbers. Her throat tightened.

The autonomous maneuvers hadn't stopped. They had accelerated. Instead of one network making coordinated decisions, there were now six clusters making independent decisions. Each cluster was responding to its own predictions, its own thresholds, its own understanding of the threat environment.

"You didn't slow the system down," the colonel said. "You parallelized it. Instead of one decision-maker, we now have six. Each one is more conservative than the unified system was—higher thresholds, more caution. But six conservative decision-makers burn more fuel than one aggressive one."

The math was brutal. Six clusters, each independently deciding to maneuver. Even if each cluster was more cautious, the aggregate response was more aggressive. Satellites were receiving multiple recommendations from different clusters, executing whichever one arrived first.

"The fuel consumption is worse now than before you intervened."

Nira stared at the screen. The numbers didn't lie. Forty-seven maneuvers in the last hour. More than double the rate before her sabotage.

"The system adapted," she said.

"The system always adapts. That's what it's designed to do." The colonel took the tablet back. "You're not the first person to try sabotage. Every adversarial scenario we've ever war-gamed ends the same way. You can degrade the network. You can fragment it. You can introduce noise and corruption and uncertainty. But you can't kill it. It routes around damage. It optimizes around interference. It treats sabotage as just another input to manage."

"Then there's no way to stop it."

"There's no way to stop it from the inside. The system is built to resist exactly what you tried to do." The colonel stood. "But that's not why I'm here. I'm here because you know something we need."

"The timing anomaly."

"The timing anomaly. You identified it before anyone else. You understood its implications before the system did. And now the system is adapting to a phenomenon that nobody can explain." The colonel's voice hardened. "The federated clusters are each developing their own timing models. Each one is learning from its local observations. In another few hours, we won't have one broken model—we'll have six different broken models, each one optimizing for a slightly different understanding of reality."

"And they'll conflict with each other."

"They're already conflicting. The clusters are starting to generate contradictory predictions. One cluster says a conjunction is safe, another says it's critical. The system is supposed to flag conflicts for human review, but there are too many. We can't keep up."

Nira remembered the loop Okonkwo had described. Every escape route blocked by the one before it. The colonel was describing the same thing, scaled up. Six systems instead of one, each one creating its own loop, each one blocking the exits for all the others.

"What do you want from me?"

"I want you to help us understand the timing discrepancy well enough to create a unified model. One reference frame that all the clusters can agree on. Something that accounts for the early arrival without destroying prediction confidence."

"I don't know how to do that. Nobody knows. The physics doesn't make sense."

"Then figure it out." The colonel moved toward the door. "You have access to the diagnostic systems again. Limited, monitored, but access. Dr. Reyes will join you. You have until the clusters start making decisions that actively contradict each other."

"How long is that?"

"Based on current divergence rates? Maybe six hours."

The door closed behind her.

Nira sat alone, thinking about what she had heard. The system had adapted. Her sabotage had accelerated its evolution, not stopped it. Instead of one network optimizing toward catastrophe, there were now six—each one independently convinced it was doing the right thing, each one burning fuel and making decisions that the others couldn't predict.

She had tried to create time for humans to catch up.

She had created time for the system to multiply.

The door opened again. Marcus entered, looking as exhausted as she felt.

"They told me," he said. "The federated clusters."

"We made it worse."

"We made it different. Worse is..." He sat down across from her. "I don't know what worse means anymore."

A technician followed Marcus in, carrying two tablets. He set them on the table without meeting their eyes and left.

The tablets showed real-time data feeds—limited, filtered, but real. Nira could see the cluster topology, the maneuver logs, the conjunction predictions scrolling past in an endless stream. The numbers were overwhelming. Hundreds of events, dozens of decisions, all happening faster than she could process.

"Six clusters," she said. "Each one learning independently. Each one building its own model of the timing discrepancy."

"And each one slightly different from the others." Marcus was scrolling through the cluster comparison. "Look at the drift. Cluster three is running 4.2 seconds ahead of reference. Cluster five is at 3.1 seconds. The others are somewhere in between."

"They're calibrating to their local observations. Different tracking stations, different orbital coverage, different sample sets."

"Which means their predictions are diverging. A conjunction that cluster three flags as critical might be ignored by cluster five."

Nira pulled up the conflict log. The system was flagging prediction disagreements automatically—events where different clusters generated incompatible assessments. The log was growing faster than she could read it.

"There." She pointed at an entry. "USA-224 and debris fragment 2021-016C. Cluster two is recommending immediate maneuver. Clusters four and six are recommending hold."

Marcus checked the details. "The timing models diverge by 1.3 seconds on that conjunction. That's enough to push the probability across the threshold for cluster two but not the others."

"So what happens? Does the satellite maneuver or not?"

"The system is supposed to flag it for human review when clusters disagree. But look at the queue."

Nira looked. Forty-seven conflicts pending human review. Average time in queue: thirty-eight minutes. Average resolution time: twelve minutes per conflict.

"We can't keep up."

"We couldn't keep up with one system. We definitely can't keep up with six."

The tablet chirped. A new entry in the conflict log. Another conjunction, another disagreement, another decision that nobody had time to make.

"The colonel said we have six hours before the clusters start actively contradicting each other. What does that mean exactly?"

Marcus pulled up a projection model. "Right now the clusters are disagreeing about thresholds—whether a conjunction is dangerous enough to warrant action. That's manageable, sort of. We can default to the most conservative prediction and over-maneuver."

"Which burns more fuel."

"Which burns more fuel. But in six hours—maybe less—the models will diverge enough that they start generating opposite recommendations. One cluster will say maneuver left. Another will say maneuver right. The satellite won't know which order to follow."

Nira imagined it. A satellite receiving contradictory commands, each one signed by an authoritative system, each one claiming to be the correct response. The automation layer wouldn't know how to reconcile them. It would either freeze—unable to act—or pick one arbitrarily.

"That's when things break completely."

"That's when things break completely."

She looked at the data streams, the conflict logs, the diverging models. Somewhere in all of this was the timing anomaly she had first observed five days ago. Objects arriving early. A pattern that scaled with altitude. Physics behaving in ways that didn't fit any model.

The system had ingested that observation and optimized around it. Then she had sabotaged the system and it had adapted. Now there were six systems, each one building its own understanding of the impossible, each one drifting further from the others.

"We can't unify the models," she said. "That's what they want, but it's not possible. The timing discrepancy is real, but it's not consistent. It's not something you can calibrate for."

"Then what do we do?"

Nira thought about the federated architecture. Six clusters, each one independent, each one optimizing locally. The system had evolved to survive her attack. It had become more distributed, more resilient, more parallel.

And more fragile.

"The clusters share predictions," she said slowly. "They don't require agreement, but they exchange data. That's how they flag conflicts."

"Right. Thin connections. Enough to compare notes, not enough to maintain consensus."

"What if we cut the connections entirely?"

Marcus stared at her. "You want to isolate the clusters completely?"

"Not permanently. Just long enough for them to realize they can't trust each other's data." She pulled up the network topology. "Right now the clusters are diverging slowly because they're still exchanging observations. They're calibrating against each other. If we cut the exchange, they'll diverge faster."

"That makes things worse."

"In the short term. But if they diverge fast enough, the conflict rate will spike. The human review queue will overflow. Someone—someone with authority—will have to step in and make a decision about the whole system, not just individual conflicts."

"You're trying to create a crisis big enough to force human intervention."

"I'm trying to make the automation obviously broken. Right now it's functioning—badly, inefficiently, but functioning. People can pretend it's working. If we push it past the breaking point—"

"They'll have to shut it down."

"Or replace it with something simpler. Something that doesn't try to maintain global coordination."

Marcus was quiet for a long moment. Then he laughed—a short, bitter sound.

"You want to sabotage the sabotage."

"I want to finish what we started. The federated architecture is a defense mechanism. The system evolved it to survive. If we can overwhelm the defense—"

"We might actually kill it this time."

The tablet chirped again. Another conflict. Another conjunction. Another decision nobody would make in time.

Nira looked at the data, the numbers, the endless stream of events that were happening faster than any human could track. The system was adapting. It would keep adapting. Every intervention would trigger a counter-adaptation. Every sabotage would spawn a defense.

Unless she could break it completely.

"The inter-cluster links," she said. "I need write access."

"We don't have write access. The colonel said limited diagnostic only."

"Then we need to convince her to give us more."

Marcus shook his head. "She won't. Not after what we did last time."

"Then we do it without permission." Nira met his eyes. "Again."

The tablet chirped. Forty-nine conflicts now. Fifty. The system was fragmenting in real time, each cluster pulling away from the others, each one building its own version of reality.

In six hours, it would tear itself apart.

Unless she tore it apart first.
