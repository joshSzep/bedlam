# 22

Four hours, seventeen minutes.

Nira stood in the back of the ESA tracking facility outside Geneva, watching the conjunction clock count down on a screen the size of a wall. The room was chaos with a pulse—controllers at stations, phones ringing, data feeds scrolling, everyone moving with the desperate energy of people who knew they were running out of time.

The dead Starlink was a ghost. SL-2847, last telemetry received thirty-one hours ago, tumbling through an orbit that no longer matched its station-keeping parameters. They could see it on radar—a bright return against the dark—but they couldn't talk to it, couldn't wake it, couldn't tell it to do anything.

GPS IIF-12 was worse. The satellite could hear commands. It could execute burns. But the fuel reserves were designed for minor orbit maintenance, not emergency avoidance. The maneuver authority was limited to 0.3 meters per second, barely enough to nudge its position over days. To dodge debris in four hours, it would need ten times that.

And even if it could maneuver, the timing schism made the prediction unreliable. The US catalog showed a 23 percent collision probability. The ESA model, recalculated with the gradient adjustment, showed 31 percent. The Russian catalog—the one they were no longer supposed to access—showed 18 percent.

Three numbers. Three realities. No way to know which one was true.

"The uncertainty is killing us," Marcus said. He was at a workstation, trying to reconcile the tracking data. "If we knew the conjunction was real, we could justify the maneuver risk. If we knew it was a phantom, we could hold. But we don't know anything."

"We know the Starlink is tumbling," Nira said. "That changes its cross-section constantly. The collision probability isn't a number—it's a range."

"Which makes it worse. The GPS satellite could maneuver into the debris instead of away from it. Or the debris could rotate into a configuration that misses entirely. Or—"

"Or we sit here and watch."

"That's what we're doing."

A commotion near the primary tracking station. One of the controllers was waving at the main screen. "New radar return. Fragment cluster, same orbital band."

The display updated. Three new objects, small, tumbling. Debris from something. Maybe the Starlink, shedding components as it spun. Maybe something else that had already collided with something else.

The conjunction prediction recalculated.

27 percent.

"It's getting worse," Marcus said.

"It was always going to get worse."

Three hours, forty-one minutes.

The US Air Force liaison arrived with news that wasn't news. GPS Program Office had evaluated the maneuver option. Risk assessment: unacceptable. The satellite would remain on station. If the conjunction occurred, they would assess damage and implement contingency operations.

Contingency operations. The phrase that meant "we've given up and we're planning for failure."

"They're not even going to try," Nira said.

"They can't try," the liaison replied. His name was Major Williams, and he had the exhausted look of someone who had been explaining the impossible for too long. "The maneuver authority isn't sufficient. If we burn everything we have, we shift the orbit by maybe two hundred meters over the next four hours. The uncertainty in the prediction is larger than that. We could move into the debris path instead of out of it."

"So we do nothing."

"We do nothing to the satellite. We're activating ground-based timing holdover across the affected sectors. If GPS IIF-12 goes dark, the ground infrastructure can maintain synchronization for approximately four hours using atomic clocks. That buys time for the other satellites to adjust coverage."

"Four hours."

"It's what we have."

Timing holdover. The backup system for when space-based timing failed. Atomic clocks on the ground, counting seconds without satellite input, drifting slowly out of sync with each other. Four hours was optimistic. In practice, the drift would start causing problems within ninety minutes.

"What about the financial systems? The power grids?"

"Alerts have been issued. The New York Stock Exchange is evaluating a precautionary trading halt. NERC has notified grid operators to monitor phase synchronization. Cell carriers are pre-positioning backup timing sources."

"You're preparing for impact."

"We're preparing for all outcomes."

The distinction felt meaningless.

Two hours, fifty-three minutes.

Dubois found her in the corridor, staring at her phone. The French physicist looked as worn as everyone else, but there was something in his expression—a calculation, a decision being made.

"There might be a way," he said.

"To do what?"

"To tighten the prediction. Make it reliable enough to act on." He glanced around, then lowered his voice. "The timing schism is the problem. Three catalogs, three predictions, three realities. But the underlying data—the radar returns, the optical tracking, the telemetry—that's all real. It's the timestamp processing that diverges."

"We've been through this. The nations won't share data across timing regimes."

"The nations won't. But the stations might."

Nira looked at him. "What are you suggesting?"

"A truth window. Sixty minutes where all tracking stations—American, European, Russian, Chinese—feed raw data to a single processing node. No timestamp correction, no regime adjustment. Just the observations, synchronized to a single atomic reference."

"You'd need every major space-tracking nation to cooperate. In the next two hours."

"I'd need the technical operators to cooperate. The people who run the stations, not the people who run the governments." Dubois pulled up a contact list on his phone. "I know most of them. We've worked together for decades, before the politics made it impossible. If I call them directly—"

"You'd be bypassing your government. And theirs."

"Yes."

"That's—" Nira stopped. She wasn't sure what it was. Treason? Insubordination? Desperate genius?

"It's a violation of sovereignty protocols. It's probably illegal under a dozen international agreements. And it might give us a prediction accurate enough to save a satellite worth three hundred million dollars and the timing infrastructure for a quarter of the planet."

"What do you need from me?"

"Access to the US Space Surveillance Network feed. Raw data, not processed. I can get Europe, Japan, Australia. I might be able to get India and Brazil. But without the American stations, there's a gap in coverage that makes the prediction useless."

"I don't have that access."

"No. But you know people who do. And you have credentials that still work in systems they haven't thought to revoke."

The analyst credentials. The ones that had let her flag the original anomaly. The ones that connected to the same networks that had turned her observation into a crisis.

"If I do this—if I pull that data and send it to an unauthorized recipient—"

"Then you've committed a federal crime. Unauthorized disclosure of classified national security information. Probably espionage, depending on who prosecutes."

"And if I don't?"

"Then we watch the clock run out and hope the twenty-three percent doesn't hit."

Two hours, nineteen minutes.

Nira made the call.

Not to the Air Force. Not to the colonel who had been her handler. To a systems administrator she'd worked with years ago, before everything went wrong. Someone who owed her a favor and might still believe in the mission more than the rules.

"Janet. I need a data feed. Real-time, unprocessed. The SSN tracking for objects in the GPS orbital band."

A pause. "Nira, I can't—"

"I know what I'm asking. I know what it costs. But there's a conjunction in two hours that might take out GPS timing for the eastern seaboard, and the only way to tighten the prediction enough to act is to combine tracking data across all the major networks. The French have a node set up. If we can get them the American data—"

"You're asking me to send classified surveillance data to a foreign government."

"I'm asking you to send tracking observations to a physicist who's trying to prevent a collision. The observations themselves aren't classified—the processing is. We're bypassing the processing."

"That's not how the lawyers will see it."

"The lawyers aren't watching a countdown clock."

Another pause. Longer this time.

"I can give you a sixty-minute window. After that, the access logs flag and I'll have to explain why I didn't stop you."

"Sixty minutes is enough."

"Nira... if this goes wrong—"

"Then it goes wrong. But at least we tried."

The data feed connected. Raw observations, streaming from stations across the United States, feeding into Dubois's coordination node. Numbers and timestamps and radar returns, the raw material of reality before politics twisted it into separate truths.

One hour, forty-seven minutes.

The truth window opened.

Data from six nations, flowing into a single processor. American stations, European stations, a Japanese optical telescope, an Australian radar installation, and—unexpectedly—a feed from India that someone had convinced to join. No Russian data. No Chinese data. But enough coverage to reduce the uncertainty.

"Running the fusion now," Dubois said. His hands were shaking. "This will take a few minutes."

The conjunction clock kept counting. The GPS satellite kept drifting toward a tumbling piece of dead metal. The world kept turning beneath them, oblivious to what was happening overhead.

In New York, trading algorithms were throwing errors. The timing drift wasn't large enough to halt transactions, but it was large enough to flag them. Review queues were building. Human traders were being pulled in to adjudicate what machines couldn't resolve.

In Houston, the power grid was showing phase warnings. The generators that supplied electricity to millions of homes were designed to synchronize their alternating current to within fractions of a degree. GPS timing kept them aligned. Without it, the phases would drift, creating oscillations that could cascade into blackouts.

In a thousand cell towers across the eastern states, backup timing systems were activating. Handoffs between towers would become less reliable. Calls would drop. Data would lag. The invisible infrastructure that connected everyone would start to fray.

And in Geneva, a French physicist and an American analyst waited for numbers that might already be too late.

"Got it." Dubois looked up from his screen. "The fused prediction. Single reference frame, all available data."

"And?"

"Collision probability is... 4.7 percent."

Nira stared at him. "That's lower than any of the individual predictions."

"Because the individual predictions were all biased by the timing schism. Each network was introducing systematic errors in opposite directions. When you combine them—cancel out the biases—you get closer to reality."

"Four point seven percent. That's low enough to hold."

"That's low enough to decide." Dubois was already sending the result to the American liaison, to the GPS Program Office, to anyone who might act on it. "If they trust this number, they don't have to maneuver. The GPS satellite survives without burning fuel it doesn't have."

"If they trust it."

"That's always the question."

One hour, twelve minutes.

The decision came down from somewhere high enough that Nira never learned who made it. The GPS Program Office accepted the fused prediction. The satellite would hold.

Now they could only watch.

The final hour was the longest of Nira's life.

The Starlink tumbled closer, its rotation creating a flickering radar return that made the trackers update their estimates every few seconds. The GPS satellite sat in its orbit, passive, vulnerable, waiting for physics to decide its fate.

At thirty minutes to closest approach, a new alert appeared on the displays.

RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE - OFFICIAL
ASAT Test: Cosmos-2551 Intercept
Launch Window: 22 hours 30 minutes
NOTAM Issued: Debris Hazard Zone, 460-520 km altitude band
Status: Interceptor fueled, launch pad ready
"Russia will demonstrate sovereign capability to defend national orbital assets"

The clock was real now. Not a threat. Not a posture. A fueled missile on a pad, pointed at the sky, ready to create the debris event that would make everything worse.

Twenty-two hours to stop it. Or to accept it.

But first—

Closest approach.

The numbers stopped jumping. The tracking feeds aligned. For one long moment, everyone in the room held their breath.

Miss distance: 147 meters.

The GPS satellite was safe. The Starlink tumbled past, close enough to see if there had been windows, far enough to avoid contact. The fused prediction had been right—the conjunction was real, but the collision probability had been inflated by the timing schism.

For about ten seconds, there was relief.

Then the operations feed updated.

TRACKING ALERT
Fragment generation detected
Source: SL-2847 (tumbling Starlink)
Cause: Structural failure during close approach (thermal stress / rotation rate)
Fragments tracked: 23 (preliminary)
Altitude: 20,200 km (GPS orbital band)

The Starlink hadn't collided. But the stress of its rotation—accelerated by the thermal cycling of passing through Earth's shadow—had finally exceeded the structural limits. The satellite had come apart. Not from impact. From the accumulated damage of tumbling uncontrolled through the void.

Twenty-three new fragments. In the GPS orbital band. Where debris persisted for centuries.

"It wasn't a collision," Marcus said slowly. "But it might as well have been."

"The debris is in a stable orbit. It's not going to decay."

"No. It's going to stay there. And every GPS satellite that passes through that band will be at risk. Forever."

The room was quiet. They had saved the satellite. They had proven the truth window worked. And it hadn't mattered, because the cascade had found another way to make things worse.

Nira looked at the ASAT announcement on her screen. Twenty-two hours. A missile waiting to launch. Thousands more fragments waiting to spread.

She thought about what she'd done to get the tracking data. The crime she'd committed. The trust she'd violated. It had worked—the fused prediction had been right, the satellite had survived.

But now Russia was going to fill that same orbital band with debris intentionally. Everything she'd risked, everything they'd proven, and it wouldn't matter if someone decided to poison the sky anyway.

Her phone buzzed. A message from a blocked number.

*The data fusion worked. We could do it again. Larger scale. If you're willing.*

She didn't recognize the sender. Didn't need to. There were only so many people who knew what she'd done, and only one of them would be reaching out through unofficial channels.

Another crime. Bigger this time. Coordinating with foreign nationals to share classified surveillance data. Maybe trying to stop an ASAT test through means that no government would authorize.

Definitely treason, if she got caught.

She looked at the debris cloud expanding on the display. Twenty-three fragments, spreading slowly into new orbits. In a few weeks, they'd be a permanent feature of the space environment. In a few years, they'd threaten dozens of satellites.

And in twenty-two hours, Russia was going to add thousands more.

Nira typed her reply.

*Tell me what you need.*

She hit send.

The line was crossed. Whatever came next, there was no going back.
