# 23

Eighteen hours to launch.

The interceptor was on the pad at Plesetsk. Satellite imagery showed the fueling arms retracted, the service tower clear. Final checks. The missile was ready. Russia's Ministry of Defense had issued a second statement: "Sovereign demonstration will proceed as scheduled. No external interference will be tolerated."

A train leaving the station. No brakes.

Nira sat in a café three blocks from the ESA facility, her laptop open to an encrypted channel she'd never used before. The message that had arrived on her phone had included instructions: a Tor address, a verification code, a time window.

The sender was waiting.

*You showed up. Good.*

Nira typed carefully. *Who are you?*

*Someone who ran the same numbers you did. Someone who watched the same systems fail. Someone who decided that rules written for peacetime don't apply when the peace is already broken.*

*That's not a name.*

A pause. Then: *Alexei Volkov. Roscosmos tracking division, Vostochny facility. Former. I was reassigned when I questioned the timing calibration protocols. Now I question other things.*

A Russian. A tracking operator who had seen the anomaly from the other side. Who had watched his own systems corrupt their predictions and had been punished for noticing.

*Why contact me?*

*Because you built a truth window. Because it worked. Because in eighteen hours, my government is going to fill the sky with debris that makes everything worse, and the only way to stop them is to prove—with data they cannot deny—exactly how bad it will be.*

*You want to scale the fusion.*

*I want to build a shadow catalog. Not a one-hour window. A permanent, parallel conjunction assessment that combines data from every major tracking network, synchronized to a neutral reference frame. Something that shows the truth regardless of which government is lying.*

Nira stared at the screen. A shadow catalog. A hidden layer of reality that existed outside the timing schism, maintained by people who had decided their governments couldn't be trusted.

It was exactly what she would have proposed if she'd thought anyone would listen.

*How many people are involved?*

*Twelve so far. Operators from six nations. We've been building the infrastructure for months, ever since the timing deviations became impossible to ignore. But we couldn't make it work. The synchronization was too hard. Then you solved it.*

*I didn't solve it. I borrowed a reference frame and got lucky.*

*You demonstrated proof of concept. That's enough. We have the stations, the bandwidth, the expertise. What we needed was someone who understood the physics well enough to design the fusion algorithm. Your colleague's gradient model—that's the key.*

Marcus. His hypothesis, refined through weeks of crisis, was now the foundation for something he'd never imagined.

*What do you want me to do?*

*Join us. Help us scale the window to a continuous feed. And when we have enough data, we publish. Not through governments. Not through agencies. Through every news outlet, every scientific journal, every channel we can reach. We show the world exactly what the ASAT debris will do. The cascade projections. The Kessler timeline. The specific satellites that will be destroyed and when.*

*That won't stop the launch.*

*No. But it might stop the next one. And the one after that. If we can make the consequences undeniable, we create political pressure that no government can ignore.*

*Unless they decide to ignore it anyway.*

*Then at least we tried. And at least the truth existed somewhere, even if no one acted on it.*

Nira thought about the GPS near-miss. The fused prediction that had been right when all the individual predictions were wrong. The twenty-three fragments now drifting through the orbital band, a permanent scar from a satellite that had died without anyone touching it.

*What about stopping this launch? Not the next one. This one.*

A longer pause.

*There might be a way. The launch window is calculated based on the predicted conjunction geometry. If we can show that the predicted impact point is wrong—that the debris will spread into a different band than Russia claims—it might trigger a technical review. Range safety protocols require accurate debris modeling. If the model is provably flawed...*

*Then they have to recalculate. Which takes time. Which might push the launch past the political window.*

*Maybe. It's not certain. But it's the only lever we have that doesn't involve missiles or sabotage.*

*That's still sabotage. Just with data instead of explosives.*

*Is it? Or is it just telling the truth in a place where lies have consequences?*

Nira didn't have an answer. The line between truth-telling and sabotage had gotten very blurry very fast.

*I need to talk to Marcus.*

*Bring him. We need his model anyway. But do it fast. We're starting the fusion window in six hours, with or without American data. If you want to contribute, you need to be connected by then.*

*Six hours.*

*Eighteen hours to launch. Twelve hours of processing to generate a credible debris projection. Six hours to publish before the launch window opens. The math is tight.*

The connection closed.

Nira sat in the café, watching the tourists and businesspeople walk past the window. Normal life. Normal concerns. A world that still functioned because systems worked, because satellites stayed in their orbits, because the infrastructure of civilization held together.

For how much longer?

She closed the laptop and went to find Marcus.

He was at the ESA facility, still working on the gradient model, still trying to understand the physics that had broken everything. When she told him about Volkov, about the shadow catalog, about the plan, he didn't speak for almost a minute.

"You're asking me to help a foreign national undermine my own government's position," he said finally.

"I'm asking you to help prevent a debris event that will destroy the orbital environment for everyone."

"By committing treason."

"By telling the truth. Through channels that governments can't control."

"That's still treason. Just with better justification."

"Is it worse than watching the sky fill with debris? Is it worse than the Kessler cascade that follows? Is it worse than losing GPS and weather satellites and communications infrastructure because we were too afraid to break the rules?"

Marcus looked at the tracking data on his screen. The debris from the Starlink collision, still spreading. The conjunction queue, still growing. The timing schism, still corrupting every prediction.

"The model," he said slowly. "If we scale the fusion, we can validate whether the anomaly is truly systematic. We can prove—mathematically, undeniably—that the timing deviation is real physics, not calibration error."

"And if we prove it?"

"Then no one can claim we're lying. No one can say the predictions are wrong because we manipulated the data. The truth becomes... undeniable."

"Is that worth the risk?"

He was quiet for a long moment. Then: "I spent my whole career trying to understand how the universe works. The whole point was that the truth matters. That reality exists independent of what we want to believe." He looked at her. "If we don't do this—if we let governments partition truth into separate versions that serve their politics—then nothing I've ever done matters."

"That's not an answer."

"Yes it is." He started packing his laptop. "Let's go commit some treason."

They never made it out of the building.

The colonel was waiting in the corridor. Two security officers flanked her. Her expression was flat, professional, the look of someone executing an unpleasant duty.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran. Dr. Chen. You're both being detained pending investigation."

"Investigation of what?"

"Unauthorized access to classified surveillance systems. Transmission of national security information to foreign nationals. Conspiracy to interfere with allied military operations." The colonel's voice was steady. "The access logs flagged six hours ago. It took us this long to confirm what you did."

Janet. The contact who had given her the data feed. Someone had traced the connection.

"The data was used to prevent a collision with a GPS satellite," Nira said. "It worked. The satellite survived."

"That's not a defense. That's a confession." The colonel stepped closer. "I warned you. I gave you access, gave you protection, gave you a role that could have made a difference through proper channels. And you chose to go around me."

"The proper channels were going to watch the satellite get hit. The proper channels are going to watch Russia poison the orbital environment in eighteen hours. The proper channels don't work anymore."

"Then you make them work. You don't burn them down and build something outside."

"Is that what you think this is? Burning things down?"

"I think you've decided you know better than the institutions that are trying to manage this crisis. I think you've convinced yourself that the rules don't apply because the situation is exceptional. And I think you're about to discover that the rules exist precisely for exceptional situations."

The security officers moved forward. Nira felt Marcus tense beside her.

"We're not going to resist," she said. "But you should know—we're not the only ones. The shadow catalog is already being built. Operators from six nations, working together outside government control. Even if you stop us, you can't stop them."

"We know about the network. We're working with allied intelligence services to shut it down."

"And Russia? China? Are they cooperating too?"

The colonel didn't answer. But her expression flickered—a moment of uncertainty that said everything.

They couldn't shut down the shadow catalog. Not without cooperation from nations that had no interest in cooperating. The infrastructure was distributed across too many countries, too many facilities, too many people who had decided that truth mattered more than loyalty.

"You're going to fail," Nira said. "Not because you're wrong about the rules. Because the rules are designed for a world that doesn't exist anymore. The timing schism broke something fundamental. You can't coordinate a global response when no one agrees on what time it is. You can't trust predictions when every prediction is biased. And you can't maintain order when order depends on systems that contradict each other."

"So your solution is chaos? A shadow network that answers to no one?"

"My solution is truth. A single, verifiable reality that everyone can see. Whether they act on it is up to them. But at least they'll know."

The security officers took her arms. She didn't fight.

"The fusion window opens in six hours," she said as they led her away. "Twelve stations, six nations, continuous feed. By the time Russia launches, there will be a debris projection so detailed that every government on Earth will know exactly what's coming. You can lock me up. You can't lock up the math."

They put her in a secure room. No windows, no phone, no laptop. Just a table, a chair, and the knowledge that somewhere above her, a missile was waiting on a pad and a network of strangers was trying to stop it.

Four hours passed.

Then the door opened.

It wasn't the colonel. It was Major Williams, the Air Force liaison from the GPS crisis. He looked like he hadn't slept in days.

"Your friends are good," he said. "The fusion window started three hours ago. We can see the data flowing, but we can't stop it without shutting down half the global tracking infrastructure. Which would be worse than letting them continue."

"I don't have friends. I have co-conspirators."

"Whatever you call them, they've generated something." He set a tablet on the table. "The debris projection from the ASAT test. Comprehensive. Detailed. And very different from what Russia published."

Nira looked at the screen.

The official Russian projection showed debris confined to a narrow altitude band—480 to 520 kilometers—decaying within three to five years. Manageable. Contained. The kind of debris event that happened occasionally and didn't change the fundamental character of the orbital environment.

The shadow catalog projection was different.

The debris cloud would spread across a much wider range—420 to 580 kilometers—due to the impact geometry and the target satellite's fragmentation characteristics. Decay times would vary from eighteen months to fifteen years. And the altitude overlap with the Starlink cascade zone meant the two debris populations would interact, creating conjunction events between fragments that would generate more fragments.

The Kessler threshold. Not in years. In weeks.

"They're not targeting what they said they were targeting," Nira said slowly. "The intercept altitude is higher than published. They're hitting Cosmos-2551 at apogee, not perigee."

"Which means the debris spreads upward instead of downward."

"Which means it overlaps with the GPS band. The same band where we just added twenty-three fragments from the Starlink breakup."

"Which means—"

"Which means if this launch goes forward, we lose the GPS constellation within six months. Not from direct hits. From the accumulated probability of thousands of conjunction events that we can't predict accurately because the timing systems are already broken."

Williams sat down across from her. "This projection—can it be verified? Independently?"

"It's based on combined data from twelve tracking stations. The fusion algorithm is open-source. Anyone with the raw observations can reproduce it."

"Including Russia."

"Especially Russia. They have access to their own tracking data. They can check our work."

"And if they check it and find we're right?"

"Then they have a choice. Launch anyway and take responsibility for destroying the orbital environment. Or stand down and admit they were wrong."

"Russians don't admit they were wrong."

"Then they launch. And the projection becomes prophecy. And everyone watches it happen exactly as we predicted."

Williams was quiet for a long moment. Then he picked up the tablet.

"I'm going to do something I probably shouldn't," he said. "I'm going to send this projection to everyone. Not through official channels. Through the same back-channels your shadow network uses. The colonel will find out. She'll probably have me arrested too. But if there's any chance that showing Russia the consequences changes their calculation..."

"There isn't. They've already committed. The public messaging, the launch window, the political positioning—they can't back down without losing face."

"Then why are we doing this?"

Nira thought about it. The question she'd been asking herself for days.

"Because the truth has to exist somewhere. Even if no one acts on it. Even if it doesn't change anything. The truth has to be recorded, preserved, made visible. So that later—when the debris is spreading and the satellites are dying and everyone is asking how we got here—there's a record. A moment when someone tried to show what was real."

"That's not very comforting."

"No. It's not."

Williams stood. "Fourteen hours to launch. The projection will be public within the hour. Whatever happens next, at least we tried."

He left. The door locked behind him.

Nira sat in the secure room, alone with the knowledge that everything she'd done—the crimes, the risks, the betrayals—might amount to nothing more than documentation.

But documentation mattered.

Because somewhere, in servers scattered across six nations, a shadow catalog was building the most accurate picture of orbital reality that had ever existed. A truth that no government controlled. A reality that no timing schism could corrupt.

And in fourteen hours, that truth would collide with a decision that had already been made.

Whatever came next, at least the record would exist.

At least the universe would remember what was real.

Even if no one else did.
