# 28

Three days to conjunction.

The NOAA operations center in Suitland, Maryland, had become the focal point of a crisis that no one knew how to solve. Screens showed the debris fragment—designated SES-17-D-447—crawling toward its rendezvous with GOES-18. The trajectory was stable. The probability was unchanged. Sixty-seven percent.

In three days, wildfire detection for the western United States would degrade from real-time to six-hour intervals. Hurricane tracking would lose its primary eye on the eastern Pacific. The early warning systems that let emergency managers make evacuation calls would go partially blind.

"We've modeled the coverage gap," the NOAA administrator said. She was addressing a room that included representatives from FEMA, the National Hurricane Center, and a dozen state emergency management directors joining by video. "If GOES-18 is lost, we can partially compensate with GOES-16 and polar orbiters. But there will be blind spots. Response times will increase. People will die who wouldn't have died with full coverage."

"How many people?"

"Depends on what happens during the gap. A major wildfire during the degraded period—maybe dozens. A hurricane hitting the coast with reduced warning—hundreds. A worst-case scenario with both..." She didn't finish.

The room absorbed the numbers. These weren't abstractions. These were neighbors, constituents, family members who would burn or drown because a piece of debris the size of a softball was traveling through space at three kilometers per second toward a satellite that couldn't move.

"What are our options?"

"We have one." The administrator pulled up a diagram. "GOES-18 has minimal propulsion capability—station-keeping thrusters only. Not enough for a full repositioning. But enough for a small adjustment. If we burn everything we have, we can shift the satellite approximately forty kilometers off its assigned slot."

"Forty kilometers. Is that enough?"

"Maybe. The debris trajectory has uncertainty bounds. If the fragment passes through the predicted center point, forty kilometers puts us clear. If it's on the edge of the confidence interval..." She shrugged. "We might move into its path instead of away from it."

The same problem that had plagued every decision since the crisis began. Predictions with uncertainty. Responses that might make things worse. No way to know until it was too late.

"What does the shadow catalog say?"

A pause. The question hung in the air—loaded with politics, with accusations, with the memory of everything that had happened since an analyst in Colorado had noticed satellites arriving early at their predicted positions.

"The shadow catalog," the administrator said carefully, "shows a tighter confidence interval. Their fusion algorithm reduces the uncertainty from plus-or-minus fifteen kilometers to plus-or-minus six. If we trust their prediction, a forty-kilometer displacement has an 89 percent chance of success."

"And if we don't trust it?"

"Then we're back to guessing."

In The Hague, Nira watched the same data on a screen in her conference room.

The shadow catalog was still running—diminished, harassed, but functional. The network had lost four stations to arrests and five more to political pressure, but the remaining operators had compensated. The predictions were still the best available. The truth was still being recorded.

Dr. Vos entered with documents.

"The ICC Prosecutor has opened a preliminary examination," she said. "Based on the evidence you've provided. The archive you transmitted—the decision timelines, the internal communications, the proof that officials knew the consequences and acted anyway—it's enough to proceed."

"Proceed to what?"

"Investigation. Eventually, potentially, charges. Against individuals in multiple governments who made decisions that constituted crimes against humanity."

"That will take years."

"Yes. And you'll need to testify. Publicly. On the record. Against your own government, among others."

Nira looked at the screen. The GOES-18 conjunction clock. Three days.

"There's something I need to do first."

"The satellite?"

"The people who depend on it. The shadow catalog has a prediction that could save GOES-18. But the agencies won't use it unless someone vouches for it. Someone they've been told is a criminal and a traitor."

"You want to make a public statement."

"I want to tell them the truth. One more time. What they do with it is up to them."

Vos was quiet for a moment. Then: "If you do this—if you make another broadcast advocating for the shadow catalog—the US prosecution will use it against you. Evidence of continuing criminal activity. It will make any future negotiation for return or amnesty impossible."

"I know."

"You'll never go home."

The word hit harder than she expected. Home. The country she had served. The career she had built. The life she had imagined, before everything changed.

"Home is where the truth is," she said. "Right now, that's not America."

---

The broadcast went out forty-seven hours before conjunction.

Nira's face appeared on screens around the world—the second time in two weeks, but this time without the shock of revelation. This time, everyone knew who she was. Criminal. Traitor. Whistleblower. Prophet. The labels varied by who was watching.

"Three days ago, I told you the truth about what was happening in orbit. Today I'm asking you to act on it."

She explained the conjunction. The probability. The coverage gap. The lives at stake.

"The shadow catalog has a prediction that could save GOES-18. It shows where the debris will be with higher accuracy than any government system. But accuracy requires trust. And trust is what we've lost."

"I'm not asking you to trust me. I'm asking you to trust the math. The fusion algorithm is open-source. Any institution with tracking capability can verify the prediction. Any government that wants to check our work can check it."

"The satellite can be saved. The coverage gap can be prevented. But only if the people making the decision use the best data available—even if that data comes from sources they've been told to reject."

"In forty-seven hours, we'll know whether truth or politics won. I hope—for everyone who depends on that satellite—that truth wins."

The broadcast ended.

Within an hour, the responses began.

NOAA announced it was "incorporating all available data sources" into its conjunction assessment. The phrasing was careful—no explicit endorsement of the shadow catalog—but the meaning was clear. They were going to use the prediction.

At NOAA's operations center, engineers began calculating the burn parameters. Forty kilometers displacement. Everything the satellite had left. A one-way ticket off the assigned orbital slot, trading coverage optimization for survival.

The burn was scheduled for thirty-one hours before conjunction.

---

The maneuver executed at 14:23 UTC on day eleven.

GOES-18's thrusters fired for seventeen minutes, consuming every gram of station-keeping propellant the satellite had left. When the burn ended, the satellite was drifting—slowly, imperceptibly—away from its assigned position. Toward a new location that might be safety or might be doom, depending on which prediction was correct.

Nira watched from The Hague. Marcus watched from Geneva, where the Swiss had given him refuge in exchange for continued access to the shadow catalog infrastructure. Volkov watched from a detention facility outside Moscow, on a smuggled phone that one of the guards had provided because even Russian prison staff wanted to know if the world was ending.

Twenty-nine hours to conjunction.

The debris fragment continued its approach. The satellite continued its drift. Two objects, both beyond anyone's control, converging toward a moment that would determine how millions of people learned about the disasters coming for them.

---

The fragment arrived at 19:47 UTC.

The shadow catalog tracked it in real time—radar returns from three continents, optical observations from two space-based telescopes, all fused into a single prediction that updated every thirty seconds as the geometry resolved.

Miss distance: 23 kilometers.

GOES-18 was safe.

The displacement had worked. The shadow catalog prediction had been accurate. The satellite would continue operating—from its new position, with degraded coverage, but operating.

In operations centers around the world, people who had been holding their breath for eleven days finally exhaled.

It wasn't a victory. Victories implied that something had been won. This was survival—narrow, costly, temporary. The satellite had been saved, but it couldn't be moved again. The coverage was degraded. The cascade was continuing. More debris was migrating upward every day.

But for now, for this moment, the truth had been enough.

---

The aftermath unfolded over weeks.

The shadow catalog didn't become official. No government formally endorsed it. No international body adopted it as standard. The political costs were too high, the admissions too damaging.

But it became real in the way that mattered.

ESA integrated the shadow catalog feed into their primary conjunction assessment. So did JAXA. So did the Indian Space Research Organisation, and the Canadian Space Agency, and a dozen commercial operators who had lost too many satellites to trust anything else.

The United States never acknowledged it publicly. But NOAA's predictions started matching the shadow catalog's with suspicious accuracy. Someone, somewhere, was feeding the data in through back channels that would never appear in any official record.

The timing schism didn't heal. GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and Beidou continued operating on separate reference frames, their predictions diverging by seconds that translated into kilometers of uncertainty. But the shadow catalog provided a bridge—a neutral layer that mapped between regimes, that showed where objects actually were regardless of which government was tracking them.

It wasn't the solution anyone had wanted. It was the solution that emerged when every other option failed.

---

The ICC investigation continued.

Nira testified for three weeks. She walked the prosecutors through the timeline—from the first anomalous observation to the final cascade, from her initial report to the decisions that had made everything worse. She named names. She showed documents. She explained, in technical detail that the lawyers struggled to follow, exactly how the systems had failed and why.

The charges, when they finally came, were directed at officials in four countries. Russia, for the ASAT test that had triggered the ISS evacuation. China, for the timing schism that had corrupted predictions. The United States, for the automated responses that had accelerated the Starlink cascade. Commercial operators, for the optimization that had made their satellites both threat and victim.

None of the defendants were ever extradited. None were ever tried. The charges existed as a record—a legal finding that what had happened was not just a tragedy but a crime. A statement that the truth had been established, even if justice would never arrive.

It wasn't enough. It was never going to be enough.

But it was something.

---

Six months after the crisis began, Nira stood on a beach in the Netherlands, watching the sun set over the North Sea.

She would never go back to America. The charges against her had been sealed but not dropped—a legal limbo that meant she could be arrested the moment she set foot on US soil. Her family had stopped calling. Her former colleagues had stopped writing. She existed in a space between countries, between identities, between the person she had been and whoever she was becoming.

Marcus visited when he could. The shadow catalog had become his life's work—maintaining the infrastructure, improving the algorithms, training the next generation of operators who would keep the truth alive. He told her the latest numbers: the cascade was stabilizing, debris generation slowing as the most congested bands became too dangerous for any satellite to occupy. In another decade, the 400-kilometer band might become navigable again. In another century, the debris might finally decay.

A new normal. Degraded but functioning. Humanity adapting to a sky that was no longer entirely theirs.

The ISS debris had reentered over the Pacific, as predicted. Most of it burned up. A few pieces reached the surface, recovered by ships that had been waiting for weeks. Museums were already competing for fragments—artifacts of the era when humans had lived in space continuously, before the cascade made it too dangerous.

Crews would return eventually. New stations would be built, more resilient, in higher orbits that the debris hadn't reached. The commercial operators were already planning, already building, already optimizing toward a future that might repeat the same mistakes in different ways.

But for now, the sky was quieter. The predictions were trusted. The truth was being told.

Nira's phone buzzed. A message from the shadow catalog network—daily update, same as always.

ORBITAL STATUS REPORT
Tracked objects: 41,847
Active satellites: 3,291
Defunct/debris: 38,556
Collision events (24h): 7
Cascade status: Stabilizing
Prediction confidence: 94.3%

The numbers that defined the new world. More debris than satellites. More past than future. More wreckage than hope.

But 94.3 percent confidence. The highest it had been since the crisis began.

The truth was working. Slowly. Imperfectly. In ways that would never be acknowledged and never be rewarded.

But working.

She put the phone away and watched the last light fade over the water. Somewhere above her, invisible against the darkening sky, thousands of objects circled the Earth—satellites still functioning, debris still spreading, the whole tangled legacy of a species that had reached for the stars and discovered that reaching had costs no one wanted to pay.

They had survived. Not through wisdom or virtue, but through the accumulated weight of small truths told by people who refused to stop telling them. Through the slow victory of reality over denial, of physics over politics, of what was over what anyone wanted to believe.

The cascade would continue for decades. The scars would last for generations. The lessons would be forgotten and relearned and forgotten again, because that was what humans did.

But somewhere, in servers scattered across six continents, the record existed. The truth had been preserved. And when the next crisis came—when the next systems failed in ways no one expected—someone would be able to look back and understand what had happened, and why, and what it had cost to learn.

That was the only victory available.

It would have to be enough.

The sky fell, and they learned to live beneath it.
