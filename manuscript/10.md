# 10

They gave Nira and Marcus a workstation in a basement room with no windows and one door.

The access was limited—read-only on most systems, write access only to the diagnostic interfaces they were supposedly helping to analyze. A handler sat in the corner, watching their screens on a mirrored display. Every keystroke logged. Every query recorded.

It wasn't enough.

But it was something.

"Show me the synchronization architecture," Nira said, pulling up the network topology. The handler—a young officer named Torres who clearly didn't understand what he was watching—glanced at his mirror and saw nothing alarming. Topology maps were diagnostic. Standard troubleshooting.

Marcus leaned over her shoulder, ostensibly reviewing her work. His voice was barely audible. "The timing distribution hub. Node seven. It's the primary relay for GPS-derived timestamps to the propagation cluster."

Nira found it. Node seven sat at the center of a web of connections—receiving atomic clock signals from the GPS constellation, processing them into the standardized timestamps that every other system depended on. If node seven started producing inconsistent outputs, every downstream process would inherit the inconsistency.

The problem was write access. She could see node seven. She couldn't touch it.

"The diagnostic interface," Marcus murmured. "It has calibration authority. For testing clock drift."

Calibration authority. The ability to inject small timing offsets to verify that downstream systems were handling corrections properly. A maintenance function. Not supposed to be used during operations.

Nira pulled up the calibration panel. A warning appeared: *Calibration mode disabled during elevated readiness status.*

DEFCON 3. The system had locked down its own maintenance functions to prevent accidental disruption during a crisis.

"Can you bypass it?"

"Maybe. The lockout is policy-based, not hardware-based. If I can convince the system that I'm running an authorized test sequence—"

"How long?"

Nira checked the system logs. The handler was still watching, but he was watching for suspicious queries, not for someone navigating menus he didn't understand.

"The next debris conjunction is in eighteen minutes. If the system is still synchronized when that conjunction hits, it'll trigger another round of autonomous maneuvers."

Eighteen minutes. She had eighteen minutes to bypass a safety lockout, inject timing corruption into the primary distribution hub, and hope that the cascade of failures would be severe enough to disable automation across the network.

Or she had eighteen minutes to fail, get caught, and lose any chance of trying again.

"Torres," Marcus said, turning to face the handler. "I need coffee. Is there a machine somewhere?"

Torres hesitated. His job was to watch them, not to fetch refreshments.

"I can call someone—"

"Don't bother. Just point me to the break room. I'll be back in five minutes."

The handler looked at Nira, at her screen full of diagnostic menus, at Marcus standing by the door. Two flagged analysts in a secure facility, under constant surveillance. What were they going to do in five minutes?

"Down the hall, second left," Torres said. "Be quick."

Marcus left. The door closed behind him.

Nira didn't have five minutes. She had maybe two before Torres started wondering why Marcus was taking so long. Two minutes to bypass the lockout, inject the corruption, and cover her tracks.

She started typing.

The lockout was policy-based—a software flag that checked the current DEFCON status before allowing calibration operations. The flag was stored in a configuration file that she couldn't modify directly. But the calibration panel had an override function for emergency maintenance. Emergency maintenance required an authorization code.

She didn't have an authorization code.

But she had access to the diagnostic logs. And the diagnostic logs showed every authorization code that had been used in the past thirty days.

She found one from two weeks ago—a routine calibration test, authorized by a technician who probably didn't know his code was being harvested by a saboteur. She copied it. Pasted it into the override prompt.

The system accepted it.

*Calibration mode enabled. Warning: Timing offsets will propagate to all connected systems. Confirm operation?*

Nira confirmed.

The calibration panel opened. A simple interface—input fields for timing offsets in microseconds, milliseconds, seconds. The system expected small adjustments, minor corrections to compensate for clock drift and signal delays.

She entered 3.7 seconds.

Not a correction. A corruption. An offset large enough to throw every timestamp in the network out of alignment with reality. Large enough to make the conjunction predictions meaningless. Large enough to break everything.

Her finger hovered over the execute button.

Seventeen minutes until the next conjunction. Torres was watching his mirror, but he was watching for queries, not for someone about to destroy the synchronization layer. Marcus was somewhere down the hall, buying her time she didn't have enough of.

She pressed execute.

For a moment, nothing happened. The system processed her input, validated it against the calibration parameters, prepared to distribute the corrupted timestamp to every node in the network.

Then the status indicators started changing.

Node seven's output shifted. The downstream systems received the new timestamp and began adjusting their internal clocks. The propagation cluster updated its reference frame. The conjunction predictions started recalculating.

But something was wrong.

The corruption wasn't propagating evenly. Some nodes accepted the new timestamp immediately. Others rejected it as anomalous—their local validation checks flagging the 3.7-second offset as outside acceptable bounds. The network was splitting. Half the systems running on corrupted time, half running on the old reference.

"What's happening?"

Torres was staring at his mirror. The status panel was lighting up with warnings—synchronization failures, timestamp mismatches, prediction conflicts. He didn't understand what he was seeing, but he knew it was bad.

"Network instability," Nira said. Her voice was steady. Her hands were not. "The timing anomaly is causing cascading errors. I'm trying to isolate it."

She wasn't trying to isolate anything. She was watching her sabotage tear the network in half.

The door opened. Marcus stepped back in, coffee cup in hand. He took one look at the status panel and went pale.

"The validation layer," he said quietly. "Some nodes have stricter bounds than others. The offset was too large for the older systems."

"Can we fix it?"

"We can't fix anything. We don't have write access to the nodes that rejected the update."

The network was now operating on two different time references. Half the systems thought it was 3.7 seconds later than it actually was. Half the systems thought the first half had gone insane. And every prediction, every conjunction warning, every automated response was now being calculated against an incoherent picture of reality.

Torres was on his feet, reaching for the phone on the wall. "I need to report this—"

"Wait." Nira stood up. "If you report a network failure right now, they'll lock down everything. Including the diagnostic access we need to understand what's happening."

"That's not your decision—"

"Look at the status panel. Look at the prediction conflicts. Half your conjunction warnings are now calculating against a different reference frame than the other half. Some of them will trigger maneuvers. Some won't. And you won't know which ones are correct until the satellites actually collide."

Torres hesitated, phone in hand.

"Give me ten minutes," Nira said. "Let me try to stabilize it. If I can't, you can report whatever you want."

She didn't intend to stabilize anything. She intended to make it worse. But Torres didn't know that. Torres just saw a network failing and an expert offering to help.

He lowered the phone.

Nira turned back to the terminal. The calibration panel was still open. She could see the distribution of the corrupted timestamp—which nodes had accepted it, which had rejected it. The split was roughly 60/40. The majority of the network was running on corrupted time.

But the minority included critical systems. The SBIRS early warning satellites were on the old reference. So were the primary tracking stations at Fylingdales and Clear. So was the Russian data-sharing link.

The Russian link.

Nira pulled up the international coordination status. The data-sharing protocol was designed to maintain synchronization between allied and partner networks. When timing references diverged, the protocol flagged it as a potential security incident—one network might be trying to feed corrupted data to another.

The Russian network had just received a synchronization warning. Their systems were seeing the American network split into two incompatible time references. From their perspective, it looked like deliberate interference. Exactly what they had suspected from the beginning.

"Marcus. The Russian link."

He was already looking at it. "They're going to interpret this as confirmation. They already thought we were spoofing them. Now our own network is generating inconsistent timestamps."

"Can we—"

"We can't do anything. We don't have access to the international protocols."

The screen updated. The Russian network had responded to the synchronization warning by activating contingency procedures. Nira couldn't read the details—they were encrypted, classified, beyond her access—but she could see the status change. The data-sharing link had shifted from green to amber to red.

The Russians had just cut off coordination with the American early warning network.

They were on their own now.

And so was everyone else.

The conjunction timer in the corner of the screen hit zero. Somewhere in orbit, two objects were reaching their predicted closest approach—a piece of debris and an active communications satellite. The network should have been tracking them in real time, coordinating predictions, recommending maneuvers.

Instead, it was arguing with itself about what time it was.

The status panel flickered. An autonomous maneuver recommendation appeared—then disappeared—then reappeared with different parameters. The system couldn't decide whether to act. Different nodes were generating different predictions. The conjunction that was happening right now looked safe to half the network and dangerous to the other half.

"It's working," Marcus whispered. "The automation is stalling."

He was right. The system wasn't making decisions anymore. It was stuck in a loop, trying to reconcile incompatible inputs, unable to reach consensus on what was real.

But something else was happening too.

Nira watched a tracking update come in from one of the ground stations—a station running on the old time reference. It showed the conjunction geometry in real time. The debris fragment and the communications satellite, passing within four hundred meters of each other.

Four hundred meters wasn't dangerous. It wasn't even close.

But the corrupted nodes didn't see it that way. Their predictions—based on the 3.7-second offset—showed the objects converging. Their risk calculations were climbing. And while the network was paralyzed by conflicting timestamps, the corrupted nodes were still trying to act.

A maneuver command fired.

Not from the consensus system. From one of the nodes that had accepted the corrupted timestamp. A single satellite—a reconnaissance bird in low Earth orbit—received an avoidance order and executed it autonomously.

The satellite wasn't even involved in the conjunction Nira had been watching. It was responding to a different prediction, a ghost threat generated by the timing offset. It burned fuel for a phantom.

And the network logged it as a successful avoidance.

"Some of the nodes are still acting independently," Nira said. "The split didn't disable automation. It just made it incoherent."

"We need to push the corruption further. Get enough nodes on the new reference that the old ones become outliers."

"We can't. The calibration panel only affects the primary distribution hub. The nodes that rejected the offset have their own internal references now. They're not listening to the hub anymore."

The network had fragmented. Not into synchronized and unsynchronized. Into multiple competing realities, each one making its own decisions based on its own understanding of time.

Torres was watching them with growing alarm. "What did you do?"

"We tried to stabilize the timing," Nira said. The lie came easily. "The network split before we could complete the correction. Now different systems are running on different references."

"Can you fix it?"

"Not from here. The affected nodes need manual intervention. Someone has to physically access them and reset their internal clocks."

"How long will that take?"

Nira thought about the network topology. Dozens of nodes scattered across the globe. Each one requiring hands-on maintenance. Each one continuing to act—or fail to act—until the reset was complete.

"Days," she said. "Maybe weeks."

Torres's face went white. He picked up the phone.

While he reported the failure to whoever was listening on the other end, Nira watched the status panel. The conjunction queue was updating—but the numbers were wrong now. Some warnings appeared and disappeared in seconds. Others stayed frozen, their timestamps uncertain. The system was trying to track threats it couldn't consistently locate in time.

Somewhere in orbit, satellites were burning fuel for phantoms. Others were ignoring real approaches because the corrupted nodes couldn't agree on when they would occur. The debris field from the Russian collision was spreading through a network that no longer knew when anything would arrive anywhere.

And the Russians were alone now. Their early warning system was still functioning—but without coordination, without shared data, without any way to know if the American network was hostile or broken or both.

Marcus sat down beside her. His voice was barely audible.

"This is worse than I expected."

"I know."

"We didn't stop the automation. We shattered it. Now there's no coordinated response at all."

"I know."

"If a real threat comes through—a conjunction that's actually dangerous—half the network will see it and half won't. The decision-making layer is paralyzed. The autonomous systems are acting randomly. We've created chaos."

Nira watched the status panel flicker. Another maneuver fired somewhere—another satellite, another ghost threat, another irreversible action.

"We've created time," she said. "That's all we have now. Time for humans to catch up. Time for someone to understand what's happening. Time for the cascade to slow down."

"And if it doesn't slow down?"

She didn't have an answer.

The phone was still in Torres's hand. He was nodding, listening, his face grim. When he hung up, he looked at them with an expression that mixed fear with something darker.

"They're sending a team. Both of you are going back into holding." He paused. "They're also scrambling repair crews to every affected node. Trying to restore synchronization manually."

"It won't work," Marcus said. "The timing anomaly is still there. The underlying physics hasn't changed. Even if they reset all the clocks, they'll just drift out of sync again."

"That's not my problem." Torres gestured toward the door. "Move."

They moved. The corridor felt longer this time, the fluorescent lights harsher. Behind them, the workstation continued displaying its fractured picture of a network at war with itself.

The sabotage had worked. Sort of. The coordination was broken. The automation was paralyzed. The cascade had been interrupted—not stopped, but slowed.

But they hadn't created clarity. They had created confusion. Multiple time references. Incompatible predictions. Isolated networks making isolated decisions.

And somewhere in Moscow, analysts were staring at their own screens, watching the American network fragment, wondering if this was the attack they had been waiting for.

The elevator took them back down to the holding level. The doors opened onto the familiar corridor, the heavy doors with their reinforced windows.

"Separate rooms," Torres said. "Until we figure out what happened."

He led Marcus away first. Nira waited, watching until the door closed.

Then her turn.

The room was the same as before. Table. Chairs. Camera with its red light blinking. No screens. No data. No way to know what was happening above.

She sat down.

The sabotage was done. The network was broken. The consequences were unfolding at machine speed across systems she could no longer see.

All she could do now was wait.

Wait, and hope that the chaos they had created was survivable.

Wait, and wonder if they had just made everything worse.
