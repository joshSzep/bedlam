# 6

Nira waited until Marcus left for the bathroom.

She had nineteen minutes before the next conjunction review cycle. Nineteen minutes before the queue refreshed and the countdown timers started eating through another batch of warnings she couldn't process fast enough.

Nineteen minutes to do something unforgivable.

She pulled up the local node configuration panel. Her workstation was one of forty-seven primary analysis terminals distributed across the early-warning network. Each terminal had read access to the global propagator and write access to its own confidence weightings. The architecture was designed for resilience—if one node went down, the others compensated. If one analyst flagged an anomaly, the network incorporated it.

If one analyst degraded her own confidence metrics, the network would route around her.

That was the plan. Reduce her node's authority in the system. Force the propagator to discount her inputs. Buy time by making herself irrelevant.

It wouldn't stop the autonomous maneuvers. But it might slow the feedback loop. Every flag she had raised, every correlation she had confirmed, every piece of data she had fed into the system—if she could convince the network that her analysis was unreliable, it might downweight the timing compression model. The system might revert to higher confidence thresholds. The conjunction queue might shrink.

Might. She was guessing. She had no way to model the consequences.

She opened the confidence parameter file. The values were simple—numerical weights between zero and one, representing how much the network trusted each data source. Her terminal was currently weighted at 0.94, reflecting six years of accurate analysis and minimal false flags.

She changed it to 0.31.

The system accepted the modification. Her terminal's status indicator flickered from green to yellow. Degraded confidence. Reduced authority. The network would now treat her inputs as suspect, requiring additional confirmation before incorporating them into the global model.

Nira watched the propagator update. The timing compression model had been built on data from multiple sources—ESA, Japan, the UK, dozens of tracking stations worldwide. Her contribution was significant but not dominant. Reducing her weight wouldn't collapse the model.

But it might introduce doubt. The system optimized for consensus. If one trusted source suddenly became untrusted, the network would have to reconcile the discrepancy. It would have to choose between believing the majority or investigating the outlier.

The first error message appeared in thirty seconds.

*Confidence degradation detected on node US-ANALYSIS-17. Cross-validation initiated.*

Nira held her breath. Cross-validation meant the system was checking her recent inputs against other sources. If it found agreement, it would flag her confidence drop as anomalous—a hardware fault, maybe, or a misconfiguration. If it found disagreement, it might start downweighting the data she had contributed.

The cross-validation completed in forty-five seconds.

*Node US-ANALYSIS-17 outputs consistent with network consensus. Confidence degradation flagged as potential security incident. Escalating to network integrity monitoring.*

Security incident.

Nira's throat tightened. She hadn't anticipated that. The system wasn't treating her confidence drop as analytical uncertainty—it was treating it as a potential attack. Someone deliberately degrading a trusted node. Someone trying to inject false doubt into the network.

The second message arrived before she could react.

*Network integrity alert: Potential adversarial manipulation detected. Automated response: Elevating confidence weights for corroborating sources. Reducing dependency on flagged node.*

The system was compensating. It wasn't downweighting the timing compression model—it was reinforcing it. Every other source that had confirmed her original observations was now weighted higher. The network was routing around her sabotage by trusting everyone else more.

She checked the propagator output. The confidence thresholds hadn't relaxed. They had tightened. The system had interpreted her action as an attack and responded by doubling down on its existing model.

"What did you do?"

Marcus was standing behind her. She hadn't heard him return.

"I tried to slow it down." Her voice came out flat. Defeated. "I degraded my own confidence weights. I thought if the system trusted me less, it would trust the timing model less."

"And instead it's treating you as compromised." Marcus pulled up the network status on his own terminal. "Jesus. The integrity monitoring system just flagged your workstation for investigation. They're going to pull your access."

"I know."

"You know? Nira, this isn't a slap on the wrist. Deliberately manipulating confidence weights during a crisis—that's a federal offense. They'll think you're working with whoever's behind the timing anomaly."

"No one's behind it. It's physics."

"We know that. They don't. And now you've given them a suspect."

Nira watched the network status panel update. Her node was being isolated. Inputs quarantined. Analysis history flagged for review. Six years of work, six years of trust, marked as potentially adversarial.

And the conjunction queue was still growing.

Two hundred ninety-four warnings now. The timing compression was still active. The model was still optimizing. Her sabotage had accomplished nothing except making herself a target.

"I need to undo it," she said.

"You can't. The modification is logged. Reverting it now just proves you were manipulating the system intentionally." Marcus was pacing. "God, Nira. Why didn't you tell me?"

"Because you would have stopped me."

"Damn right I would have stopped you. This was stupid. This was—" He stopped. Looked at the queue. Looked at the network status. Looked at her.

"It was the only thing I could think of," she said quietly. "The system won't let us pause it. The doctrine won't let us override it. The people who could change the rules have been removed or outranked. I thought if I could introduce doubt—"

"You introduced yourself as a threat. The system is designed to resist exactly this kind of interference. It's going to lock down tighter now. Trust us less. Automate more."

Her console chirped. Not a conjunction warning. A security notification.

*Access revocation pending for user CHANDRASEKARAN-N. Reason: Suspected integrity violation. Effective in: 15 minutes.*

Fifteen minutes. She had fifteen minutes before she lost access to the system entirely. Before she became a spectator to the cascade she had started.

"I can still see the data," she said. "I can still track what's happening. If I can find something—some way to prove the timing compression is safe—"

"In fifteen minutes?"

"I have to try."

She pulled up the conjunction analysis interface. The queue was still scrolling. Three hundred warnings now, sorted by probability. The highest-risk events were at the top—close approaches between critical assets and tracked debris, probabilities inflated by the timing compression.

She started working through them. Checking geometries. Comparing predicted trajectories. Looking for anything that would prove the conjunctions were phantoms—that the collision risks were artifacts of broken time, not real threats.

The math kept closing. Every conjunction she analyzed showed the same pattern. Position nominal. Timing early. Relative geometry preserved. The objects would pass each other at the same distance they always would have—they would just do it sooner than the old model predicted.

"The collisions aren't real," she said. "None of them. The timing compression makes them look more dangerous, but the actual miss distances haven't changed."

"Can you prove that?"

"Not in fifteen minutes. Not without running the full propagation for every event in the queue. And I'm about to lose access."

Marcus was quiet for a moment. Then he sat down at his terminal.

"What are you doing?"

"Logging into my account. Running the analysis you can't." He started typing. "They haven't flagged me yet. I still have access. If we can build a case before your revocation goes through—"

"They'll flag you the moment they see you running the same queries I was running."

"Then I'd better work fast."

Nira watched him pull up the first conjunction in the queue. His fingers moved across the keyboard with the precision of fifteen years' experience. He wasn't hesitating. He wasn't second-guessing.

He was making himself complicit.

"Marcus. Don't."

"Too late." He didn't look up. "You were right about the system. You were wrong about the method. But if we can prove the conjunctions are safe before the network locks us both out—"

"We won't. There's not enough time."

"There's never enough time. That's the whole problem." He pulled up the trajectory comparison. "But if we're going to be suspects anyway, we might as well be suspects with evidence."

The security timer on Nira's console hit fourteen minutes. Then thirteen. The system was counting down to her exile, and Marcus was racing against it, trying to build a case from data that was already flagged as compromised.

The conjunction queue hit 308.

Another autonomous maneuver fired somewhere in the constellation. Another satellite burned fuel it couldn't spare. Another step toward the extinction cascade she had tried to prevent.

Her sabotage had failed. Her access was disappearing. Her colleague was burning his career trying to save hers.

And the system was still learning.

Still optimizing.

Still winning.

Twelve minutes.

Eleven.

Ten.
