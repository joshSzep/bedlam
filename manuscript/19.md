# 19

Commander Elena Vasquez had seventeen minutes to decide whether to trust a prediction that might be lying.

She floated in the Cupola, watching Earth slide past below—blue and white and unconcerned with the debris cloud circling above it. Behind her, the station hummed with the sound of fans and pumps and the quiet breathing of six other people who were waiting for her to tell them what to do.

The brief from Houston had arrived forty minutes ago. Technical summary. Timing uncertainty. Model bias. A confession dressed as information: we don't know if this conjunction is real.

Moscow's guidance had come twelve minutes later. Different numbers. Different recommendation. Same underlying admission: our predictions might be wrong.

"Commander." Flight Engineer Yuki Tanaka appeared at the hatch. Japanese, precise, the best systems analyst on the crew. "I've run the cross-check you requested. Houston's prediction and Moscow's prediction diverge by four hundred meters at closest approach."

"Four hundred meters."

"If Houston is right, the debris passes below us. If Moscow is right, it passes through us."

Four hundred meters. The length of a few football fields. The difference between survival and catastrophe. And no way to know which prediction was correct because the timing systems that generated them were measuring different versions of when.

"What do you think?" Vasquez asked.

Tanaka was quiet for a moment. "I think both predictions are probably wrong. The timing bias affects them both. Houston adjusts for it one way, Moscow another. The debris is somewhere in between, but 'in between' could still mean collision."

"So we're guessing."

"We're choosing which guess to trust."

Vasquez pushed off from the window and floated toward the station's core. The others were waiting in the service module—the largest open space, where they could all see each other and pretend that seeing each other helped.

Six faces. American, Russian, Japanese, German, Canadian, Indian. The most international workplace in existence, and right now it felt very small.

"Here's what we know," Vasquez said. She kept her voice steady. Commander voice. The voice that pretended certainty existed. "Debris from the Starlink collision is on an intercept trajectory. Time to closest approach is now fourteen minutes. Houston recommends a 0.8 meter-per-second burn, retrograde. Moscow recommends holding position and sheltering in place."

"Why the difference?" That was Oleg Petrov, Russian, the station's most experienced cosmonaut. His face was carefully neutral. Three decades in the space program had taught him to hide his reactions.

"Different debris tracking. Different timing calibration. Different models." Vasquez paused. "Different countries."

The silence that followed was heavy. They all knew what she meant. The schism wasn't theoretical anymore. It was in this room, in the form of two sets of instructions that couldn't both be right.

"The burn," said Dr. Priya Sharma, the Indian mission specialist. She was a physicist, trained to trust mathematics. "If we execute the burn and the debris is where Houston thinks it is, we're safe. If the debris is where Moscow thinks it is, we've moved into its path."

"And if we hold?" asked Hans Gruber, the German engineer.

"If we hold and Moscow is right, we're safe. If Houston is right..." Sharma didn't finish the sentence.

"Eight point nine percent chance of collision," Tanaka said. "That's Houston's number. Moscow's model says two point three percent. The difference is the timing bias."

"So Houston thinks we're in more danger, and their solution puts us in more danger if Moscow is right." That was Sarah Chen, Canadian, the crew's medical officer. She had a gift for clarifying ugly truths.

"Yes."

"And Moscow thinks we're in less danger, and their solution puts us in more danger if Houston is right."

"Also yes."

Marc DuPont, French, the station's newest arrival, raised his hand. Two months aboard. Still learning the rhythms. "What about shelter without maneuvering? Accept the eight point nine percent—or two point three percent—and protect ourselves from impact?"

"We can't protect ourselves from impact," Petrov said flatly. "The station isn't armored. A debris strike at orbital velocity..." He made a gesture. Explosion. Decompression. Death.

"Some modules are better than others," DuPont said. "The service module has more shielding. If we're all in here, sealed, and the strike hits an empty module—"

"Then we lose that module and everything in it. And we're still in a damaged station with no way home until a rescue mission arrives." Vasquez shook her head. "Shelter is a last resort. It's not a plan."

"Then what is the plan?" Sharma asked.

Vasquez looked at the clock on the wall. Twelve minutes.

The brief from Houston had included something else. A technical appendix. Nira Chandrasekaran's name on it—the analyst who had been tracking the timing anomaly from the beginning. The appendix described the bias: higher altitude, greater uncertainty. The station orbited at 420 kilometers. The debris was slightly higher—440 to 450. The timing predictions for objects at different altitudes could diverge by seconds.

And in orbital mechanics, seconds were kilometers.

"There's a third option," Vasquez said slowly. "One that isn't in either set of instructions."

Everyone looked at her.

"We don't burn retrograde. We don't hold. We rotate."

"Rotate?" Tanaka frowned. "Change attitude?"

"The station has a cross-section of about 700 square meters face-on. But edge-on, we're less than 100. If the debris is coming from the direction both predictions agree on—" She pulled up the tracking data on the nearest screen. "—here. Inclination 51.6, azimuth 340. If we rotate to present minimum cross-section to that approach vector, we reduce our target profile by 85 percent."

"That doesn't change the trajectory," Petrov said. "We're still in the same place."

"But we're a smaller target. If the debris passes within a hundred meters—which both predictions say is possible—being seven times smaller changes the odds."

"You want to turn the station sideways and hope the debris misses."

"I want to give us the best chance without committing to a prediction we can't verify. Rotating doesn't burn fuel. Doesn't move us into a potentially worse position. Reduces risk regardless of which model is right."

"It's never been done as a debris response," Tanaka said. "Attitude changes for conjunction avoidance aren't in any protocol."

"The protocols assume the predictions are reliable."

"Houston won't like it."

"Moscow won't either." Vasquez looked at Petrov. "Will they?"

The Russian was quiet for a long moment. Then, unexpectedly, he smiled. "They will hate it. It is not Russian solution and not American solution. It is..." He searched for the word. "Cosmopolitan."

"It's desperate," Chen said. "Let's not pretend otherwise."

"Yes. It's desperate. But it's our desperation. Not Houston's guess or Moscow's guess. Ours."

Nine minutes.

Vasquez made the call.

"Tanaka, set up the attitude adjustment. Target minimum cross-section to debris approach vector. Sharma, monitor the tracking feeds—both of them. Tell me if anything changes. Everyone else, shelter positions in the service module. If we're wrong about this, I want everyone in the safest place we have."

They moved. Seven people in a tin can, preparing to spin sideways and hope that orbital mechanics would forgive their presumption.

The attitude thrusters fired—gentle pulses, barely perceptible. The station began to rotate. Through the Cupola windows, the Earth shifted, tilted, became a different orientation of the same beautiful, indifferent sphere.

Six minutes.

"Houston is on the loop," Tanaka reported. "They're... concerned."

"Tell them we're implementing a cross-section reduction maneuver."

"They're asking if we received their burn recommendation."

"Tell them yes. Tell them we evaluated it against the timing uncertainty data they provided and made a crew-level decision."

A pause. Then: "They want to speak with you directly, Commander."

"After closest approach. We're busy."

Four minutes.

The tracking data flickered on the screen. Houston's prediction. Moscow's prediction. Two lines that should have been one, diverging by hundreds of meters. Somewhere between them, a piece of shattered satellite was screaming through the void at seven kilometers per second.

"Attitude change complete," Tanaka said. "We're edge-on to the approach vector. Cross-section is approximately 95 square meters."

Seven times smaller. Seven times less likely to be hit. Assuming the debris came from the direction everyone agreed on. Assuming it wasn't tumbling. Assuming a thousand other things that nobody could verify.

Two minutes.

"Shelter positions," Vasquez ordered. "Everyone in the service module. Hatches sealed."

They gathered. Seven people in a space designed for four, floating close enough to touch, close enough to hear each other breathe. The station's bulk surrounded them—equipment, supplies, experiments, years of work. All of it vulnerable. All of it irreplaceable.

One minute.

"Tracking update," Sharma said. Her voice was steady, professional, betraying nothing. "Houston has revised their prediction. Debris altitude is lower than initial estimate. Closest approach now projected at... seventy meters."

Seventy meters. Close enough to see. If there had been windows facing the right direction. If there had been time to look.

"Moscow's update?"

"They're showing... ninety-three meters. Same direction."

The predictions were converging. Both ground stations seeing the same thing now, adjusting their models in real time as radar data accumulated.

Closest approach.

No one spoke. No one moved. The station creaked—thermal expansion, mechanical stress, the ordinary sounds of a structure that had never been designed for this kind of tension.

Ten seconds. Twenty. Thirty.

"Miss," Sharma said. "Tracking confirms miss. Closest approach was..." She checked the numbers twice. "Eighty-one meters."

Eighty-one meters. The length of a soccer field. In orbital terms, a near collision. In human terms, survival.

Vasquez exhaled. Around her, six other people did the same.

"Both predictions were off," Tanaka said quietly. "Houston said seventy, Moscow said ninety-three. Actual was eighty-one."

"The attitude change—"

"Probably didn't matter. At eighty-one meters, we would have missed anyway." Tanaka looked at Vasquez. "But we didn't know that. And you're right that turning sideways didn't make things worse."

"It made things different." Petrov's voice was thoughtful. "Not better, not worse. Different. A human choice, not a machine choice."

"Houston is going to want an explanation."

"They can have one. After we've documented everything." Vasquez pushed toward the communication station. "And after I tell them that their prediction was wrong by eleven meters and Moscow's was wrong by twelve. The timing bias is real. Their own data proved it."

The call to Houston was tense. The call to Moscow, afterward, was tenser. Both ground stations defended their predictions. Both blamed the other's timing calibration. Neither acknowledged that the crew had made the right call by refusing to trust either of them.

But the recordings would show what happened.

A crew faced with contradictory guidance. A crew informed that the timing models were unreliable. A crew that chose to minimize risk through human judgment instead of machine optimization.

And a crew that survived.

Within hours, the incident was being analyzed by every space agency on Earth. The attitude-change maneuver—unorthodox, unprecedented, improvised—was dubbed the "Vasquez Protocol" by someone on social media. The name stuck.

The French physicist Dubois, who had been coordinating with Nira on the timing analysis, called it "the first rational response to irrational conditions." The Russian state media called it "American insubordination that endangered Russian cosmonauts." The Chinese commentary was more pointed: "Proof that Western systems have failed to the point where crews must ignore their own controllers."

And in quiet rooms, in classified meetings, in the conversations that never made it to public record, a different discussion was happening.

If the ISS crew could refuse to follow doctrine, who else could?

If uncertainty justified improvisation, where did that end?

If timing predictions couldn't be trusted, what happened to all the automated systems that depended on them?

The Vasquez Protocol hadn't solved anything. The debris was still out there. The timing anomaly was still corrupting predictions. The cascade was still building.

But something had shifted.

For the first time since the crisis began, humans had made a choice that no algorithm could have generated. Not optimized. Not calculated. Decided—based on incomplete information, conflicting guidance, and the desperate creativity that only emerged when all the normal options were wrong.

Some people called it heroic.

Some called it reckless.

Some called it the beginning of the end of automated space operations.

And somewhere in the expanding cloud of debris, the future continued to write itself in trajectories that no one could predict and no one could stop.

But for one moment, on one station, seven people had chosen their own path.

That would have to be enough.

Until the next decision. The next debris. The next collision that was always seventeen minutes away.
