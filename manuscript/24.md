The truth hit the world at 03:47 UTC.

Dr. Yuki Sato, astronomer at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, was the first to see it. She had been monitoring the shadow catalog feed since Volkov's network had added her facility—quietly, without government knowledge—and when the debris projection appeared on her screen, she sat motionless for almost a minute.

The numbers were worse than anyone had predicted publicly. Worse than the Russian claims. Worse than the worst-case scenarios the agencies had been circulating internally.

She picked up the phone and called a journalist she trusted.

By 04:15, the projection was being verified. Reuters had three independent sources confirming the intercept geometry. The Associated Press was cross-referencing with ESA tracking data that someone had leaked an hour earlier. Bloomberg's space desk was running the cascade simulations on their own servers, getting the same results.

By 04:30, it was everywhere.

BREAKING: Shadow network reveals Russian ASAT debris will trigger Kessler cascade
LEAKED: Secret tracking data shows intercept altitude higher than claimed
ANALYSIS: GPS constellation at risk within months if launch proceeds

In New York, a trading desk at Goldman Sachs received the alert at 04:33. The analyst on duty—a twenty-eight-year-old named Rebecca Chen who had never thought much about satellites—read the summary and felt her stomach drop. GPS timing. Financial infrastructure. Settlement risk.

She called her supervisor.

By 04:45, derivatives tied to satellite insurance were moving. By 05:00, the VIX was spiking. By 05:15, the pre-market was showing signs of the kind of volatility that preceded major corrections.

In Atlanta, a grid operator at Southern Company pulled up the risk memo that had landed in his inbox. The assessment was stark: if GPS timing degraded as projected, power grid synchronization would require manual intervention within hours. The cascade scenarios showed blackout risks across the eastern interconnection.

He started calling every plant manager on his list.

The truth was propagating. Not through official channels. Through the network of people who understood what the numbers meant and couldn't stay silent.

Six hours to launch.

The National Security Council convened at 05:30 Washington time. The President was briefed. The options were thin.

"The projection is credible," the NASA administrator said. Her voice was flat, exhausted. "Our analysts have verified the intercept geometry. The shadow catalog's fusion algorithm is sound. If Russia launches at the published window, the debris distribution will be substantially worse than their public claims."

"Can we stop them?"

"Diplomatically? We've been trying for eighteen hours. They're not responding to back-channel communications."

"Militarily?"

A pause. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs shifted in his seat. "We could attempt to intercept the interceptor. We have assets that could theoretically reach it before impact. But that would be an act of war. Against a nuclear power. Over a debris projection."

"A debris projection that shows the destruction of our GPS constellation."

"A debris projection from an unauthorized shadow network that's currently being investigated as an intelligence breach."

The room was quiet. The contradiction was stark: the shadow catalog was simultaneously the best source of truth about the crisis and a criminal conspiracy against the governments trying to manage it.

"What about the people who built it?" the President asked. "The American sources. Can they validate the projection officially?"

"Dr. Chandrasekaran and Dr. Chen are in custody. Dr. Chandrasekaran has refused to cooperate with interrogation. She says the projection speaks for itself."

"Bring her to me."

In Geneva, ESA's operations center was running on emergency protocols.

The shadow catalog had been integrated—unofficially, without formal authorization—into their conjunction assessment pipeline. The fusion data was simply better than what they had been working with. More accurate. More consistent. The timing bias that had corrupted everything for weeks was finally being corrected, at least within the shadow network's coverage.

"We're seeing real-time confirmation," the operations director reported to his counterpart at JAXA. "The intercept trajectory matches the projection. Russia is targeting apogee, not perigee. The debris will spread upward."

"What are your options?"

"We're moving everything we can to safer orbits. But we don't have fuel for major maneuvers. Most of our constellation was already stressed by the Starlink cascade."

"Same here. We're looking at losing three satellites in the first week if this goes forward. More in the following months."

"The Americans?"

"GPS can't maneuver. They're essentially fixed targets. If the debris spreads as projected..."

"Then we all lose GPS. And everything that depends on it."

The conversation didn't need to continue. They both understood.

At SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, the crisis team had been working through the night.

The Starlink constellation was already damaged—847 satellites dark, another 400 in degraded orbits, the cascade barely contained. The shadow catalog projection added a new dimension of threat: if the ASAT debris overlapped with their operational band, they would lose another thousand satellites within months.

"We need to make a statement," the chief operations officer said. "Publicly. Before the launch window."

"Saying what? That we support an illegal shadow network over official government sources?"

"Saying that the projection is credible and that we're repositioning our constellation based on it. Let the implications speak for themselves."

"The board won't approve that. It's too political."

"The board won't have a constellation to manage if we don't act. Politics is a luxury we can't afford right now."

The statement went out at 06:15 UTC. SpaceX was implementing "precautionary orbital adjustments" based on "independent technical analysis." The shadow catalog wasn't named. It didn't need to be.

OneWeb followed an hour later. Then Amazon's Kuiper program. Then the major satellite insurers, who announced they were "reassessing coverage terms pending resolution of current orbital uncertainty."

The private sector was voting with its actions. The shadow catalog was becoming the de facto standard—not because governments endorsed it, but because it was the only source of truth that worked.

Nine hundred kilometers east of Moscow, at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, General Dmitri Kozlov stood in the launch control center and watched the countdown clock.

Four hours, twenty-three minutes.

The interceptor was ready. The target—Cosmos-2551, a defunct reconnaissance satellite—was approaching the optimal intercept point. Everything was proceeding according to plan.

Except for the projection on his tablet.

One of his engineers had pulled the shadow catalog data an hour ago. Against orders. Against protocol. Because the engineer had spent thirty years tracking objects in space and couldn't ignore data that contradicted everything his government was saying.

"It's accurate," the engineer—Colonel Petrov, no relation to the cosmonaut on the ISS—said quietly. "I've checked it against our own tracking. The intercept geometry is correct. The debris distribution will be as they project."

"That's not what the ministry published."

"The ministry published what they were told to publish. The physics doesn't care about politics."

Kozlov looked at the projection. The debris cloud spreading upward. The overlap with the GPS band. The cascade timeline showing Kessler onset within weeks.

"If we launch," he said slowly, "we destroy the orbital environment."

"Yes."

"Not just for the Americans. For everyone. Including us."

"Yes."

"Does Moscow understand this?"

"Moscow understands that backing down now would be seen as weakness. That the West would claim victory. That our enemies would be emboldened." Petrov's voice was bitter. "Moscow has decided that demonstrating resolve is more important than preserving the commons."

"And if I refuse to launch?"

"Then someone else will push the button. And you will be arrested. And the outcome will be the same."

Kozlov stared at the countdown clock. Four hours, nineteen minutes.

He had spent his career defending Russia. Protecting its interests. Following orders because orders came from people who understood the bigger picture.

But the bigger picture was on his tablet. The debris cloud. The cascade. The destruction of infrastructure that Russia depended on as much as anyone else.

"There might be another way," he said.

Nira was brought to a video conference room at 07:30 UTC.

The screen showed a face she recognized from news coverage: the President of the United States, looking as tired as everyone else who had been managing this crisis.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran. I'm told you built the projection that's currently destabilizing global markets and terrifying every space agency on Earth."

"I helped build the infrastructure. The projection was generated by a network of operators from six nations."

"A network you organized."

"A network I joined. It existed before me. It will exist after me."

"That's not reassuring."

"It's not meant to be. The network exists because the official systems failed. Because the timing schism made government predictions unreliable. Because someone had to build something that worked."

"And now Russia is four hours from launching an ASAT weapon, and your projection is the only thing anyone trusts."

"That's not my fault. That's physics."

The President was quiet for a moment. Then: "I'm going to ask you something, and I need an honest answer. Is the projection accurate? If Russia launches, will the debris distribution be as bad as your network claims?"

Nira thought about the question. About all the ways she could hedge, qualify, protect herself.

"Yes," she said. "The projection is accurate. We've verified it against tracking data from twelve independent stations. The intercept geometry is confirmed. The debris spread models are consistent with established fragmentation physics. If Russia launches, the debris will overlap with the GPS band. The cascade will begin within weeks. Within six months, the orbital environment between 400 and 600 kilometers will be unusable."

"Unusable."

"Too much debris to safely operate. Too many conjunction events to avoid. Every satellite in that band will be at constant risk. Some will be hit. The fragments will generate more conjunctions. The cycle will continue until there's nothing left."

"And there's no way to stop it? No cleanup, no mitigation?"

"Not with current technology. Not in the timeframe that matters. Once the debris is there, it's there for decades. We would have to wait for atmospheric drag to slowly pull it down. During that time, the band is denied to everyone."

The President absorbed this. Then: "What would you do? If you were in my position?"

"I would make the projection undeniable. Release every piece of supporting data. Every tracking observation, every fusion calculation, every verification check. Make it so clear that no one—not Russia, not China, not anyone—can claim the projection is Western propaganda."

"That would expose intelligence sources. Reveal capabilities."

"The shadow network already exposed those. The data is already public, for anyone who knows where to look. The only question is whether the United States validates it officially, or lets the shadow catalog become the de facto authority."

"And if we validate it?"

"Then Russia has to choose. Launch and take responsibility for destroying the orbital environment, with the whole world watching. Or stand down and claim some other reason—technical issue, scheduling conflict, whatever saves face."

"You're asking me to bet the credibility of the United States government on a projection from an illegal network."

"I'm asking you to bet on physics. The network just did the math."

Three hours to launch.

The US government released a statement at 08:15 UTC. The shadow catalog projection was "consistent with independent analysis by US Space Command." The intercept geometry was confirmed. The debris distribution would be "substantially more severe than Russian public claims."

It wasn't an endorsement. It wasn't an accusation. It was a careful, precise validation that made the shadow catalog's numbers undeniable.

Russia responded within the hour.

"American psychological warfare," the Ministry of Defense declared. "Falsified data designed to undermine legitimate sovereign defense activities."

But the response was different in tone. Defensive. Uncertain. The kind of statement that came from people who knew they were losing the narrative.

At Plesetsk, General Kozlov received new orders at 09:30 UTC.

He read them twice. Then he called Colonel Petrov.

"We're not launching Cosmos-2551."

"The test is cancelled?"

"No. The test is... redirected." Kozlov's voice was flat. "We're targeting a different satellite. Lower altitude. Different intercept geometry."

"Which satellite?"

Kozlov showed him the orders.

Petrov went pale. "That's insane. The debris from that intercept would—"

"Would stay below 400 kilometers. Would decay within months. Would not threaten the GPS band."

"But it would destroy the ISS orbital corridor. The crew would have to evacuate."

"Moscow has determined that demonstrating capability is more important than maintaining the station. The Americans and Europeans can bring their people home. We will bring ours."

"This is—"

"This is what happens when you back a nuclear power into a corner and demand they show weakness." Kozlov's voice was hard now. "They chose a target that hurts everyone equally. Including themselves. Because equal pain is better than unilateral surrender."

The new target was Cosmos-1408. A defunct ELINT satellite at 480 kilometers—but in a different orbital plane. One that would scatter debris across the ISS corridor instead of the GPS band.

Not the apocalypse the shadow catalog had predicted.

Something worse in a different way.

At 11:47 UTC, with forty-three minutes remaining in the original launch window, Russia announced a "technical modification to the sovereign orbital demonstration."

At 12:15 UTC, the interceptor launched.

At 12:23 UTC, Cosmos-1408 was destroyed.

The debris cloud began to spread.

Fifteen hundred fragments, initial estimate. Spreading across an altitude band from 340 to 520 kilometers. Overlapping with the International Space Station's orbit.

The ISS crew had been warned. They were already in their spacecraft, ready to evacuate if necessary.

But they couldn't evacuate from an expanding debris field. They could only wait, and hope, and watch the conjunction predictions multiply.

The shadow catalog had prevented one catastrophe.

Russia had chosen another.

And the crisis entered its next phase—not with the destruction of GPS, but with the most international workplace in history suddenly trapped in a shooting gallery of its host nation's making.

Nira watched the launch footage from her holding room. The plume of exhaust. The bright flash of intercept. The cloud of fragments beginning their long, slow spread across the sky.

She had told the truth. The truth had mattered. And the outcome was still catastrophe.

Just a different catastrophe than the one she'd tried to prevent.

The universe didn't care about intentions. It only cared about trajectories.

And now there were fifteen hundred new trajectories to track, to predict, to fail to avoid.

The cascade continued.
