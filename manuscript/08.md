# 8

The stairwell was empty.

Nira climbed past the second floor landing, her footsteps echoing off concrete walls. No alarms. No security personnel waiting to intercept her. The system had flagged her as a threat, but the system was busy. Three hundred conjunction warnings demanded more attention than one revoked analyst walking through a building.

She reached the third floor and pushed through the fire door into the corridor. The propagation team's offices were at the far end—a cluster of workstations where the mathematicians lived, the people who translated orbital mechanics into predictions the rest of the network could use.

Dr. Okonkwo's door was closed.

Nira knocked. No answer. She tried the handle—locked.

"He's not here."

She turned. A young analyst she didn't recognize was standing in the hallway, tablet in hand, looking at her with the careful neutrality of someone who had heard about her status.

"Where is he?"

"Conference room B. Emergency working group." The analyst hesitated. "You probably shouldn't be up here."

"Probably not."

Nira walked past him toward conference room B. She could feel his eyes on her back, could imagine him checking his tablet, confirming her name against the security alert list. By the time she reached the conference room, someone would know she was here.

It didn't matter. The system already knew everything about her. What mattered was reaching someone who could still act.

The conference room door was glass. Through it, she could see Okonkwo at the head of a table, surrounded by screens displaying data she couldn't read from this distance. Other faces she half-recognized—propagation specialists, a liaison from Space Command, someone in civilian clothes who might have been a contractor.

She pushed the door open.

Every head turned. Okonkwo's expression shifted from concentration to surprise to something harder.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran. You shouldn't be here."

"I know. I have about three minutes before security arrives, so I'll talk fast." She stepped into the room, letting the door close behind her. "The timing compression model is generating false positives. The conjunctions aren't real. You're burning fuel on phantom threats."

"We're aware of the false positive hypothesis." Okonkwo's voice was careful, controlled. "We're also aware that you attempted to manipulate your confidence weights to corrupt the model. That action is why you're no longer part of this conversation."

"The manipulation failed. The system compensated by trusting other sources more. The model is intact." Nira moved closer to the table, trying to see the screens. "What I'm telling you is that the model itself is the problem. The timing discrepancy doesn't affect collision probability. It only affects when the conjunction occurs. The relative geometry is preserved."

"We've considered that." The civilian contractor spoke up—a thin woman with gray-streaked hair and the flat affect of someone who had been in too many crisis meetings. "The problem is we can't prove it. Every analysis that supports your hypothesis was generated by flagged personnel. The system has downweighted all of it."

"Then run new analyses. Independent verification. The math is the same regardless of who does it."

"We don't have time." Okonkwo pulled up a display. "This is the conjunction queue as of two minutes ago."

Nira looked at the screen. Three hundred forty-one warnings now. The number had jumped by almost thirty since her access was revoked.

"And this," Okonkwo continued, "is the maneuver log."

A second display. A list of satellite designations, timestamps, fuel expenditures. Nira scanned the entries, counting. Seventeen autonomous maneuvers in the last hour. Seventeen satellites that had burned fuel to avoid debris that wasn't going to hit them.

"You're watching the constellation die."

"We're watching the constellation respond to a crisis." Okonkwo's voice hardened. "A crisis that you helped create by flagging an anomaly you didn't understand and feeding it into a system designed to learn from trusted inputs."

The words hit like a physical blow. Nira had known she was responsible. She had felt it in her gut since the moment the first model update completed. But hearing it spoken aloud, in a room full of people who could see the damage she had caused—

"I flagged what I saw. The sensors weren't lying."

"No. But the system's response to what you saw is destroying our orbital infrastructure." Okonkwo stood. "I'm sorry, Dr. Chandrasekaran. I believe you acted in good faith. I believe the phenomenon is real. But I can't help you. Everything you touch is now suspect. Every recommendation you make will be filtered through the assumption that you're compromised."

"Then make the recommendation yourself. Tell them the conjunctions are false positives. Tell them to stop the maneuvers."

"I tried. Two hours ago." Okonkwo's face was exhausted. "The recommendation was rejected. Doctrine requires us to respond to threats above threshold. We can't change the threshold without STRATCOM authorization. STRATCOM won't authorize changes during a DEFCON elevation. The elevation won't be reduced until confidence is restored. Confidence can't be restored until we understand the timing anomaly. We can't study the timing anomaly because all resources are committed to responding to the conjunction queue."

A perfect loop. Every escape route blocked by the route before it.

"There has to be something—"

The door opened behind her. Two security officers in uniform, hands resting on their belts.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran. You need to come with us."

Nira didn't move. "Dr. Okonkwo. The maneuvers are making things worse. Every satellite that burns fuel becomes more vulnerable. Every vulnerability creates more conjunctions. You're feeding the loop."

"I know." Okonkwo's voice was barely audible. "I know."

The security officers stepped forward. Nira let them take her arms, let them guide her toward the door. She kept her eyes on Okonkwo's face, looking for any sign that her words had landed, that something might change.

Okonkwo looked away.

The officers led her into the corridor. The young analyst was gone—probably the one who had reported her. The hallway stretched ahead, fluorescent lights humming, perfectly ordinary except for the armed escorts on either side of her.

"Where are you taking me?"

"Security holding. Pending investigation."

"I need to know what's happening. The conjunction queue. The maneuver rate. I need—"

"You don't have clearance for that information anymore."

They reached the elevator. One officer pressed the call button while the other kept a hand on Nira's elbow. The grip wasn't rough, but it was firm. She wasn't a prisoner, but she wasn't free either.

The elevator doors opened. Inside, a screen on the wall displayed a news feed—public information, unclassified. Nira watched it as they descended.

The anchor was talking about military aircraft movements. Unusual dispersal patterns. Speculation about exercises or heightened tensions. The footage showed a B-52 taking off from a base somewhere in the Midwest, its wings heavy with pylons.

DEFCON 3 was visible from the ground now. Anyone with a camera could see the response. Anyone with a brain could guess that something was wrong.

The elevator reached the ground floor. The officers escorted her through a series of corridors she didn't recognize, past offices and checkpoints, until they reached a small room with a table, two chairs, and no windows.

"Wait here."

They left. The door locked behind them.

Nira sat in one of the chairs. The room was silent—no screens, no feeds, no connection to the network that was still running without her. She was completely blind now. No data. No alerts. No way to know if the maneuvers were continuing, if the queue was growing, if the system was still eating the constellation alive.

All she had was her memory.

Three hundred forty-one conjunctions. Seventeen maneuvers in the last hour. Fuel reserves depleting across the fleet. DEFCON 3 in effect. Bombers dispersing. The Russians convinced they were under attack.

And somewhere above her, satellites were still burning, still dodging threats that didn't exist, still following the orders of a system that couldn't be wrong because it was never wrong—it was only ever optimizing.

She thought about the timing discrepancy. Objects arriving early. A pattern that scaled with altitude. Something wrong with the relationship between space and time at orbital distances.

She still didn't understand it. Nobody did. But she understood what it was doing to the system. The uncertainty was being converted into action. Every unknown was being treated as a threat. Every threat was being neutralized with precious, irreplaceable resources.

The system was defending itself to death.

And she was sitting in a windowless room, waiting for someone to decide what to do with her, while the defense continued without pause.

Minutes passed. Maybe hours. She had no way to measure time except by the growing stiffness in her back and the slow fade of adrenaline into exhaustion.

When the door finally opened, she expected another security officer. Another escort. Another step in the process of being processed.

Instead, she saw Marcus.

His face was pale. His access badge was missing from his lanyard.

"They flagged me completely," he said. "Thirty minutes after you left. Locked out of everything."

"How did you find me?"

"Asked around. Some people still talk to us." He stepped into the room, letting the door close behind him. "Nira, something happened. While we were being processed."

"What?"

"A near miss. Real one, not a phantom. Two satellites—a commercial imaging bird and a piece of debris from the 2009 collision. They passed within eighty meters of each other."

Eighty meters. Close enough to be catastrophic. Close enough that even a small error could mean destruction.

"Did they collide?"

"No. But the imaging satellite tried to maneuver. Autonomous avoidance." Marcus sat down across from her. "The burn triggered thirty seconds before the closest approach. Thirty seconds. The old model would have flagged it minutes earlier. The compressed thresholds made the system wait until the last possible moment."

"Wait. That's backwards. The compression should make it trigger earlier, not later."

"It did trigger earlier—earlier in clock time. But the satellite arrived at the conjunction point earlier too. From the satellite's perspective, from the physical geometry, the warning came later than it should have."

Nira felt the implications settling into place. The timing compression affected everything—predictions, thresholds, response windows. If the system was adjusting for early arrival but the early arrival was systematic, then the adjustments cancelled out. The net effect was zero.

Except when it wasn't.

"The debris," she said. "Was it included in the timing model?"

"I don't know. I lost access before I could check."

"If it wasn't—if the debris was treated with the old timing but the satellite was treated with the new timing—"

"Then the predictions would be misaligned. The system would think it had more time than it actually did."

The near miss hadn't been a success. It had been luck. Eighty meters of margin where the system thought it had hundreds. A collision avoided not because the automation worked, but because the geometry happened to be forgiving.

Next time it might not be.

"We need to tell someone."

"Who? We're both flagged. No one will listen to us."

"Then we need to tell everyone." Nira stood up. "Public channels. Unclassified networks. If we can't reach the people running the system, we reach the people watching it. Make the problem visible."

"That's treason. Releasing classified information during a crisis—"

"What's the alternative? Wait here while the system optimizes its way into a Kessler cascade?" She was pacing now, the small room suddenly claustrophobic. "The near miss proves the model is broken. Not just generating false positives—generating false negatives too. Real threats being missed because the timing adjustments are inconsistent."

Marcus was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was barely above a whisper.

"They'll never let us near a terminal again. We won't be able to prove anything. We'll just be two disgraced analysts making wild claims about physics nobody understands."

"Maybe. But at least we'll have tried."

The door opened again. A security officer stood in the frame.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran. Dr. Reyes. You're being transferred to a secure facility pending full investigation. Please come with me."

Nira looked at Marcus. He looked back. Neither of them moved.

"Now, please."

They stood. They followed. The corridor stretched ahead of them, and somewhere above them, satellites were still burning, still dodging, still waiting for orders from a system that no longer knew what was real.

And the near miss was just the beginning.
