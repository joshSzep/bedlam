# 9

The van had no windows in the back.

Nira sat on a metal bench, wrists zip-tied in front of her, watching Marcus across the narrow space. Two security officers occupied the front seats, separated from them by a steel mesh partition. The engine hummed. The road noise was constant and featureless.

They had been driving for twenty minutes. Maybe thirty. Without windows, without a phone, without any connection to the outside world, time had become abstract.

"Where do you think they're taking us?"

Marcus shook his head slightly. Not here. Not with guards listening.

Nira understood. Everything they said could be used. Everything they planned could be intercepted. The system had isolated them, and now it was containing them, and soon it would process them through whatever institutional machinery handled people who had become inconvenient.

The van slowed. Stopped. Outside, she could hear voices—muffled, indistinct. Then the vehicle lurched forward again, through what sounded like a gate or checkpoint.

More driving. Five minutes. Ten.

When the van finally stopped and the rear doors opened, Nira squinted against the sudden daylight. They were in a parking structure—concrete pillars, fluorescent lights, the smell of exhaust and recycled air. A secure facility that could have been anywhere.

"Out. Both of you."

They climbed down from the van. More security personnel waited—four of them, enough to make the point. One of them cut Nira's zip ties with a practiced motion.

"This way."

Through a door. Down a corridor. Into an elevator that required a keycard and a PIN. The numbers on the panel went down, not up. Basement levels. Subterranean.

The elevator opened onto a hallway lined with heavy doors. Each door had a small window, reinforced glass, showing empty rooms beyond. Holding cells. Interview rooms. The architecture of containment.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran, this way. Dr. Reyes, you're in the next room."

They were being separated.

Nira looked at Marcus. His face was pale but composed. They had known this was coming. They had talked about it, obliquely, in the minutes before the security officers arrived. Whatever happened next, they wouldn't be able to coordinate. They wouldn't be able to plan.

They would each have to decide alone.

"Marcus—"

"I know." He held her gaze. "I know."

They led him away. The door closed between them.

Nira's room was small—a table, two chairs, a camera in the corner with its red light blinking. No windows. No screens. No connection to anything outside these walls.

She sat. She waited.

The door opened forty minutes later. A woman in civilian clothes entered—middle-aged, sharp-eyed, carrying a tablet. She sat across from Nira without introducing herself.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran. You've had an eventful few days."

"I flagged an anomaly. The system overreacted."

"The system responded according to doctrine. You then attempted to manipulate your confidence weights, accessed restricted areas without authorization, and attempted to communicate classified information to personnel outside your clearance chain." The woman set her tablet on the table. "Those are federal offenses."

"The conjunction warnings are false positives. The maneuvers are wasting fuel. I was trying to stop a catastrophe."

"That's not your decision to make."

Nira felt the familiar frustration rising. The same loop she had encountered with Okonkwo, with Chen before he was removed, with everyone in the chain of command. The system was correct by definition. Challenging it was the error.

"How bad is it?" she asked. "The fuel consumption. The maneuver rate. How many satellites have we lost?"

The woman's expression didn't change. "That information is classified."

"I had clearance until yesterday. I know what the queue looked like. Three hundred plus conjunctions. Maneuvers every few minutes. The constellation is burning through reserves that took decades to build."

"Dr. Chandrasekaran—"

"And it's not just us. Every network that confirmed the timing anomaly is doing the same thing. ESA. Japan. Probably Russia and China too. Everyone is maneuvering to avoid phantoms. Everyone is depleting their fleets."

The woman was quiet for a moment. When she spoke again, her voice was softer.

"There was a collision. Forty minutes ago."

Nira's breath caught.

"A defunct Russian communications satellite and a debris fragment from the 2007 ASAT test. The Russian network attempted an autonomous avoidance maneuver, but the timing was off. The satellite fired its thrusters three seconds too late."

"The timing compression. Their model adjusted for early arrival, but—"

"The debris wasn't in their adjusted catalog. Old tracking data. Inconsistent timing assumptions." The woman's jaw tightened. "The collision generated approximately two thousand new debris fragments. Initial tracking suggests at least forty will cross active orbital regimes within the next seventy-two hours."

Two thousand fragments. Each one a potential bullet. Each one requiring tracking, prediction, avoidance. Each one feeding the conjunction queue that was already overwhelming every network on the planet.

"The cascade has started," Nira said.

"The cascade has started."

Nira stared at the table. She had been afraid of this since the moment she understood what the timing compression was doing. Satellites burning fuel. Running dry. Becoming debris. Creating more conjunctions. Forcing more maneuvers. A feedback loop that wouldn't stop until the orbital environment became unusable.

And now it wasn't theoretical. It was happening. Two thousand new pieces of debris, spreading through orbits that held communications satellites, weather platforms, GPS constellations, early warning systems.

"What do you want from me?"

"Cooperation." The woman leaned forward. "You understand the timing anomaly better than anyone still available to us. Dr. Okonkwo's team is overwhelmed. The propagation models are failing. We need someone who can help us understand what we're dealing with."

"I tried to help. You locked me in a cell."

"You tried to manipulate the system. That's not help. That's sabotage." The woman's eyes were hard. "But you also identified the pattern before anyone else. You understood that the relative geometry was preserved. You were right about the physics, even if you were wrong about the method."

"So you want me to fix it."

"I want you to advise. Quietly. Off the record. Help us understand the timing discrepancy well enough to adjust the models correctly."

Nira thought about it. A chance to get back into the system. To see the data again. To influence the response.

But on their terms. Under their control. Feeding information to people who would use it however they saw fit.

"And if I refuse?"

"Then you stay here until the investigation concludes. Months, probably. By then, the orbital environment will be..." The woman didn't finish the sentence. She didn't have to.

By then, the orbital environment would be a graveyard.

"I need to know what's happening," Nira said. "Real-time data. The conjunction queue. The maneuver log. The debris tracking."

"That can be arranged."

"And Marcus. Dr. Reyes. He stays with me."

"Dr. Reyes is being offered a similar arrangement."

"Not similar. The same. We work together or I don't work at all."

The woman studied her for a long moment. Then she nodded.

"I'll see what I can do."

She left. The door locked behind her.

Nira sat alone in the small room, thinking about the collision. Two thousand fragments. The Russian satellite had tried to dodge and failed. The timing was off. Three seconds too late.

Three seconds.

The same margin that had started everything. The same impossible discrepancy she had flagged four days ago, when an intercept warning fired early and she thought she was doing the right thing by reporting it.

She had told the system the truth. The system had believed her. And now the system was killing satellites because it couldn't reconcile the truth with its own assumptions.

The door opened again. This time it was Marcus.

He looked worse than before—tired, shaken. He sat down across from her without speaking.

"They told you about the collision," Nira said.

"They showed me footage. Thermal imaging from one of our birds. You could see the debris cloud expanding." He rubbed his face with both hands. "Two thousand fragments, Nira. And that's just the first one."

"They want us to help fix the models."

"I know. They made me the same offer." Marcus lowered his hands. "Did you accept?"

"I told them I needed to work with you."

"That's not an answer."

"No. It's not."

They sat in silence. Somewhere above them—far above, in the vacuum where the rules were different—debris was spreading through orbital shells that had taken fifty years to populate. Every fragment was a future conjunction. Every conjunction was a future maneuver. Every maneuver was fuel that couldn't be replaced.

"If we help them," Marcus said slowly, "we're legitimizing the system that caused this. We're telling them their approach works, it just needs tweaking."

"If we don't help them, the cascade continues without any correction at all."

"So we're choosing between bad and worse."

"We're always choosing between bad and worse. That's the only choice the system leaves us."

Marcus was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke again, his voice was different. Harder.

"There's another option."

Nira waited.

"The timing anomaly is real. The physics is real. But the system's response is broken because it's trying to maintain global synchronization across a reference frame that doesn't support it." Marcus leaned forward. "What if we don't try to fix the models? What if we break them completely?"

"Break them how?"

"Inject enough uncertainty that the system can't trust any timing data. Force it to fall back to local reference frames only. Each satellite, each tracking station, each subsystem operating on its own clock without trying to synchronize with the global network."

"That would destroy the early warning system. No coordinated tracking. No shared predictions. No automated response."

"The automated response is what's killing us. Every time the system tries to optimize, it makes things worse. The only way to stop the cascade is to stop the optimization."

Nira felt the weight of what he was proposing. Not adjustment. Not correction. Deliberate destruction of the coordination layer that made global space surveillance possible.

"We'd be blind," she said. "Every nation. Every network. No shared picture of what's happening in orbit."

"We're already blind. We just don't know it yet." Marcus's eyes were steady. "The system thinks it understands the timing. It doesn't. It's making decisions based on a model that's fundamentally wrong. Breaking the model is the only way to stop it from making more wrong decisions."

"And the debris? The two thousand fragments that are spreading right now?"

"We track them locally. Individual stations, individual predictions. Slower. Less coordinated. But not optimized for a physics that doesn't exist."

Nira thought about the offer the woman had made. Cooperation. Legitimacy. A chance to work within the system and make incremental improvements.

She thought about the collision. Three seconds too late. A model that was wrong in ways nobody understood.

She thought about all the choices that had led to this moment—flagging the anomaly, confirming the pattern, trying to sabotage her own confidence weights. Every decision made with incomplete information. Every action creating consequences she couldn't predict.

"If we do this," she said, "we can't take it back. We'll be destroying capability that took decades to build. Even if it works—even if it stops the cascade—we'll have crippled global space surveillance for years."

"I know."

"They'll prosecute us. Not just security violations. Treason. Sabotage of national defense systems."

"I know."

"And we might be wrong. The timing anomaly might resolve. The models might stabilize. We could be destroying something that was about to fix itself."

"We could." Marcus didn't look away. "But we won't know until it's too late. That's the whole problem. We never know until it's too late."

Nira closed her eyes. She could see the numbers in her memory—three hundred conjunctions, seventeen maneuvers per hour, fuel reserves depleting across every constellation on the planet. And now two thousand new fragments, spreading through the orbital environment like infection through a wound.

The system was optimizing. The system was always optimizing. And the optimization was killing everything it was designed to protect.

"How would we do it?" she asked.

Marcus took a breath. "They're going to give us access. Limited, supervised, but access. If we can reach the synchronization layer—the part of the network that maintains global time reference—we can corrupt it. Introduce noise. Make the timestamps unreliable."

"They'll notice immediately."

"They'll notice. But by the time they figure out what happened, every automated process that depends on synchronized time will have failed. The conjunction predictions will become useless. The autonomous maneuvers will stop. The system will have to wait for human decisions."

"And humans are slow."

"Humans are slow. That's the point." Marcus's voice was barely above a whisper. "We can't make the system smarter. We can't make it understand physics it wasn't designed for. The only thing we can do is make it stop. Force it to wait. Give humans time to catch up."

Nira opened her eyes. The small room felt smaller now. The camera in the corner was still recording. Whatever they decided, it was already on tape.

It didn't matter. The decision was already made.

"When they bring us back in," she said, "we do it. First opportunity. No hesitation."

Marcus nodded. "No hesitation."

They sat in silence, waiting for the door to open, waiting for the access they had been promised, waiting to destroy something that couldn't be saved any other way.

Above them, debris was spreading.

The cascade was accelerating.

And they had just committed to making everything worse before it could get better.
