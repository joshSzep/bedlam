The first response came from France.

Not through official channels. Through a secure back-channel that the colonel hadn't known existed until the message arrived.

"Centre National d'Études Spatiales confirms independent observation of timing deviation," Nira read from the screen. "Request immediate technical consultation. Propose joint calibration standard. Await response."

Three hours since the diplomatic transmission. Three hours since the Starlink collision. And someone had actually read the document, understood it, and wanted to talk.

"That's not de-escalation," the colonel said. "That's an opening."

"It's more than we had."

"It's also an admission that their systems are affected too. If they're confirming the anomaly, they're confirming vulnerability."

"Everyone's vulnerable. That's the point."

The colonel stared at the message. In the background, the operations center continued its controlled chaos—the debris cloud from the Starlink collision was still expanding, still being tracked, still generating new predictions.

"Reply affirmatively," the colonel said finally. "Establish the consultation channel. But keep it narrow. Technical only. No policy implications."

As if physics could be separated from policy. As if agreeing on how time worked wouldn't reshape everything that depended on time.

But it was a start.

The second response was less encouraging.

FLASH TRAFFIC - PRIORITY
People's Republic of China - Ministry of Foreign Affairs
"United States admission of 'timing anomaly' confirms deliberate manipulation"
"China demands immediate cessation of GPS-based timing interference"
"All cooperative agreements suspended until infrastructure restored"

They had read the document. They had drawn the opposite conclusion.

"They're calling the anomaly an admission of guilt," Nira said.

"They're using it as one. Whether they believe it or not." The colonel pulled up the intelligence summary. "Their space agency has been seeing the same deviations we have. Their military has been scrambling to explain why their conjunction predictions keep failing. Our transmission gave them a choice: accept that this is a natural phenomenon affecting everyone, or claim we're attacking them and use it for political advantage."

"They chose advantage."

"They chose what their system rewards. Same as ours."

The operations display updated. The debris cloud from the Starlink collision had completed its first orbit. The tracking systems had refined their estimates.

DEBRIS FIELD ANALYSIS - UPDATE
Fragments tracked: 412 (revised upward)
Fragment size range: 1cm - 2.3m
Orbital distribution: 412-428 km altitude band
Conjunction predictions generated: 2,847 (next 72 hours)

Two thousand eight hundred forty-seven new conjunction predictions. Each one a decision point. Each decision point a potential response. Each response creating new predictions.

And that was just from one collision.

"We can't review that manually," Nira said. "Not even close."

"Protocol Seventeen allows automated response for debris-only conjunctions. Human review is only required for crewed or high-value assets."

"So we're back to automation. For most of it."

"We never left automation. We just created a carve-out for the things we cared about most."

The display flashed again. A priority alert.

CONJUNCTION ALERT - ELEVATED
Object: Starlink debris fragment (SLD-17-023)
Target: NOAA-20 weather satellite
TCA: 14:23 UTC (7 hours 12 minutes)
Probability: 0.031
Action: Review required (high-value asset)

Debris from the collision was already threatening other satellites. Not Starlink satellites—NOAA-20. A weather satellite. Part of the infrastructure that tracked hurricanes, predicted floods, enabled the forecasts that millions of people relied on every day.

"Can we maneuver NOAA-20?"

"Checking." The colonel consulted with an analyst. "Limited capability. It's not designed for frequent orbital adjustments. If we move it now, we might not be able to move it again for weeks."

"And if we don't move it?"

"Three percent chance of collision. Which sounds low until you remember that we thought the Starlink conjunction was below threshold too."

The predictions couldn't be trusted. The responses created new risks. And the debris was already spreading into critical infrastructure.

"What about the commercial operators? The debris is in their orbital bands."

"SpaceX is still running automated responses. They've lost contact with fourteen satellites in the past two hours—fuel exhaustion from continuous maneuvering. OneWeb is considering a full stand-down. Amazon's Kuiper constellation is delaying their next launch batch."

"Delaying?"

"Insurance. The underwriters are recalculating risk based on the debris environment. Launch premiums just tripled."

The economic consequences were arriving. Not someday. Now.

Nira's phone buzzed. Marcus.

"The gradient model," he said without preamble. "I've refined it. The altitude correlation is tighter than I thought. Almost linear above 400 kilometers."

"That's good?"

"That's useful. I can predict the timing uncertainty for any altitude with maybe ten percent accuracy. Which means I can tell you which conjunction predictions are most corrupted."

"We tried that with SpaceX. They ignored it."

"Because I was telling them which predictions to ignore. Now I can tell them which predictions to trust. The ones at lower altitudes, shorter baselines. The uncertainty there is small enough that the predictions might actually be valid."

"Might."

"Better than nothing. But there's a problem."

Of course there was.

"If the anomaly is real—if time actually runs differently at different altitudes—then there's no way to synchronize a global timing standard. Every reference frame above Earth's surface is experiencing time at a different rate than the ground stations. The more precisely we measure, the more the discrepancy shows."

"We knew that."

"We suspected it. Now I can prove it. The data fits a relativistic model, but with an additional term. Something beyond what general relativity predicts. I don't know what's causing it, but I can show that it's systematic."

"What happens when you show it?"

"That's the problem." Marcus paused. "If this is real physics—if there's an actual temporal gradient that we didn't know about—then it means GPS has never been as accurate as we thought. Every timing system based on satellite signals has been slightly wrong, always. We just never measured precisely enough to notice."

"And now we're measuring precisely enough."

"And now the precision is killing us. The better our systems get, the more they diverge from each other. The more they diverge, the more they disagree about where things are and when things will happen. The anomaly isn't new. Our ability to see it is."

Nira felt the weight of it. Not an attack. Not a malfunction. A fundamental limit that had always been there, hidden by the noise, revealed by the optimization.

"If you publish this—"

"Then everyone knows the timing infrastructure is broken. Not hackable. Not fixable. Broken at the physics level. Every system that depends on precise synchronization becomes suspect. Financial markets. Power grids. Communications. Military coordination."

"Everything."

"Everything that matters."

The choice crystallized in front of her. The transmission to allied and adversary nations had been a half-measure—sharing the data, hinting at the explanation, hoping someone would understand. But Marcus's proof was different. Publication would force acknowledgment. Would make it impossible to pretend the problem could be solved with better calibration or more careful procedures.

Would also make it impossible to trust any timing-dependent system ever again.

"The colonel is here," Nira said. "I'm putting you on speaker."

She walked to where the colonel was reviewing the NOAA-20 conjunction data and held up the phone.

"Dr. Chen," the colonel said. "I assume you're not calling with good news."

"I'm calling with proof. The timing anomaly is real, systematic, and probably caused by physics we don't understand. I can demonstrate it mathematically. If I publish, it ends the debate about whether this is an attack or a natural phenomenon."

"It also ends confidence in every timing-dependent system on Earth."

"That confidence is already misplaced. We're just making it official."

The colonel was quiet for a moment. Then: "What do you need from us?"

"Cover. If I publish independently, it looks like a leak. Possibly treason. If the government validates the findings first, it looks like transparency."

"You want us to endorse the destruction of trust in our own infrastructure."

"I want you to be ahead of it. Because someone else will figure this out. The French are already suspicious—that's why they responded to your transmission. China's scientists know something is wrong, even if their government is blaming us. Russia's tracking systems are seeing the same deviations. The truth is coming out. The only question is whether it comes out as a confession or an attack."

The colonel looked at Nira. "Your assessment?"

"He's right. The anomaly is already driving decisions. The Starlink collision happened because systems couldn't agree on where satellites were. The ISS had to maneuver because predictions were contradictory. Russia is threatening war because they think we're attacking them. If we don't explain what's actually happening, everyone keeps responding to a threat that doesn't exist."

"And if we do explain, they might stop trusting the systems entirely. Which could be worse."

"They should stop trusting the systems. The systems are wrong."

The colonel turned away, facing the main display. The debris cloud. The conjunction alerts. The cascade of automated responses creating new cascades.

"I need authorization," she said finally. "This is above my level."

"How long?"

"Hours. Maybe less, given the situation."

"The French want a technical consultation. That's a natural venue. If we present the findings there, jointly, it's international science rather than American admission."

"That's... actually smart." The colonel reached for her secure phone. "I'll make the call. Dr. Chen, prepare your documentation. Dr. Chandrasekaran, you're the liaison. If this goes forward, you're explaining it to the French."

"And if it doesn't go forward?"

"Then we keep pretending the systems work until they kill someone. Which might be today."

She walked away to make her call.

Nira turned back to the phone. "You heard?"

"I heard. I'll have the paper ready in two hours."

"Make it one. The debris cloud isn't waiting."

The next hour was chaos with purpose.

Marcus compiled his analysis. Nira coordinated with the French contact—a physicist named Dubois who specialized in satellite timing and had been quietly documenting anomalies for months. The colonel worked the authorization chain, escalating through levels of bureaucracy that had never contemplated this kind of decision.

And the debris cloud continued its orbit.

At 11:47 UTC, a second collision occurred.

COLLISION ALERT - CONFIRMED
Objects: SLD-17-089 (Starlink debris) / CZ-4C R/B (Chinese rocket body)
Time: 11:47:32 UTC
Debris generated: Estimated 890 fragments
Orbital altitude: 445 km

A fragment from the Starlink collision had hit a Chinese rocket body. A piece of American commercial infrastructure destroying a piece of Chinese space debris. The symbolism was devastating.

"They're going to call this an attack," Nira said.

"They're going to call it whatever serves them." The colonel had returned. "Authorization came through. We're going public. Joint statement with France, technical documentation attached. The White House is drafting talking points."

"When?"

"Forty minutes. They want to beat the Chinese response to the second collision."

"Will it work?"

"It'll change the narrative. Whether it changes behavior..." The colonel shrugged. "We're about to find out."

The joint statement went out at 12:30 UTC.

France and the United States, acknowledging a previously uncharacterized timing discrepancy affecting satellite-based navigation and coordination systems. Natural phenomenon, under investigation. All nations affected equally. Preliminary data consistent with an unmodeled relativistic effect requiring updated calibration standards.

Dry language for a world-changing admission.

The response was immediate.

ESA requested inclusion in the investigation. Japan endorsed the findings and released their own anomaly data. India announced formation of an independent review panel.

Russia declared the statement "disinformation designed to excuse American aggression" and announced creation of a sovereign timing standard, divorced from GPS and Galileo, based on GLONASS and ground-based atomic clocks.

China said nothing. For three hours.

Then the announcement came.

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY - OFFICIAL
"People's Republic of China announces Beidou Autonomous Timing Initiative"
"All Chinese space assets to transition to independent temporal reference"
"GPS/Galileo/GLONASS synchronization suspended effective immediately"
"Global timing 'schism' reflects Western system failure, not natural phenomenon"

The split was formal now. Three timing regimes: Western (GPS/Galileo), Russian (GLONASS sovereign), Chinese (Beidou autonomous). Each nation measuring time against its own reference. Each reference disagreeing with the others by seconds that grew larger with altitude.

"They've partitioned space," Marcus said over the phone. "Different countries will literally experience different versions of orbital reality."

"Can that work?"

"Short term, maybe. Long term, it makes coordination impossible. If a Chinese satellite and an American satellite are tracking the same debris field, they'll generate different predictions. Different maneuver decisions. Different outcomes."

"More collisions."

"Guaranteed more collisions. They've chosen sovereignty over survival."

The colonel was reading the intel summary. "Russia just raised their ASAT systems to full readiness. Not threatening use. Demonstrating capability."

"Because they think we're lying about the physics."

"Because they think it doesn't matter if we're lying. Their doctrine says: protect assets, maintain deterrence, accept risk to others. The timing anomaly—real or fake—is just context. The response is the same either way."

The display updated. Another collision alert.

CONJUNCTION ALERT - CRITICAL
Object: SLD-17-156 (Starlink debris, 2nd generation)
Target: ISS
TCA: 19:45 UTC (7 hours 3 minutes)
Probability: 0.089
Action: IMMEDIATE REVIEW

Debris from the second collision—the one that hit the Chinese rocket body—was now threatening the International Space Station.

"Eight point nine percent," Nira said. "That's not a phantom."

"No. That's real." The colonel turned to her operations team. "Get me NASA. Get me ROSCOSMOS. And get me the crew manifest. I want to know who's up there and what their options are."

The cascade had reached the humans.

Three hundred forty fragments from the first collision. Eight hundred ninety from the second. Each one a new trajectory. Each trajectory a new prediction. Each prediction filtered through timing systems that disagreed about when now was and where here meant.

And at 19:45, one of those trajectories might intersect with seven human beings in a station that couldn't run and couldn't hide.

"We need to tell them," Nira said. "The crew. They need to know what's actually happening."

"They know there's a conjunction."

"They don't know the predictions might be wrong. They don't know the timing systems are diverging. They don't know that if they maneuver, they might be moving into the debris instead of away from it."

"Telling them that helps how?"

"It lets them make an informed decision. Instead of trusting automation that can't see straight."

The colonel considered. "Draft a brief. Technical summary. What we know, what we don't, what the uncertainty bounds are. I'll authorize transmission to the station."

"They might choose not to maneuver."

"They might. That's their right." The colonel turned back to the display. "It's also the first time anyone's had that choice in days."

Nira started drafting.

Behind her, the operations center hummed with activity. The debris cloud continued its orbit. The conjunction queue grew. The timing systems diverged.

And in seven hours, the International Space Station would face a decision that no algorithm could make for them.

Trust the prediction and maneuver.

Distrust the prediction and hold.

Or do something no one had considered yet.

The systems had brought them here—optimizing, protecting, responding to threats real and phantom until the responses became the threat.

Now it was up to the humans.

Whatever they chose, the cascade would continue. The debris would spread. The timing would diverge. The parallel realities of sovereign time standards would drift further apart.

But for seven hours, at least, someone would get to decide.

That had to count for something.

Even if it changed nothing at all.
