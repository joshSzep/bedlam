By 06:00, Nira had ruled out the sensors.

She had pulled calibration logs from both tracking stations. She had compared oscillator drift against the GPS timing standard. She had checked the tropospheric correction models, the ionospheric delay compensation, the relativistic adjustments that accounted for satellite motion and gravitational potential differences. Everything was within specification. Everything was working exactly as designed.

The sensors weren't lying. They were reporting what they saw.

What they saw was impossible.

The shift change brought Marcus Reyes onto the floor. Senior systems analyst, fifteen years in the network, the kind of institutional memory that made him the first call when something didn't fit the manual. He dropped into the station next to hers and pulled up the overnight log before she could brief him.

"You flagged a timing anomaly."

"Five of them. Correlated across independent targets."

"I see seven now." He was scrolling through the alert queue. "System's been busy."

Nira's stomach dropped. She had submitted one report. The system had found more.

"It's learning," she said. "I flagged the pattern, and now it's applying the model to historical data."

"Retroactive reclassification." Marcus didn't sound surprised. "The propagator's designed to do that. You give it a new failure mode, it goes hunting."

"This isn't a failure mode. The sensors are clean."

"Then what is it?"

She didn't have an answer. She had spent three hours trying to construct one, and every hypothesis collapsed under the weight of the data. Clock drift couldn't explain correlated early arrival across multiple ground stations. Atmospheric anomalies couldn't produce systematic effects that scaled with orbital altitude. Software bugs didn't create patterns that obeyed geometry.

"I need independent confirmation," she said. "Something outside our network."

Marcus was already typing. "ESA's got a space surveillance radar at Santorcaz. Spanish Air Force facility. Different hardware, different software, different timing chain. If they're seeing the same thing—"

"Then it's not us."

"Then it's not us."

He sent the query through the data-sharing protocol. Encrypted. Flagged as verification request. The European Space Agency didn't answer to the same chain of command, but orbital tracking was a collaborative domain. Debris didn't care about borders. Neither did collisions.

The response came in eleven minutes.

Nira read it twice. Then a third time.

"They've been seeing it for two days," she said.

Marcus leaned over to read her screen. The ESA data showed the same pattern. Early arrival. Baseline-dependent. Scaling with altitude. Their analysts had logged it as a systematic error in their own propagator and submitted a bug report to the software team.

"They thought it was their problem," he said.

"It's everyone's problem."

She pulled up the comparison. Two completely independent systems—different radars, different clocks, different continents—observing the same objects and agreeing on the discrepancy. The timing residuals matched to within a tenth of a second. The altitude correlation was identical.

This wasn't instrumentation. This wasn't processing. This wasn't coincidence.

Something was wrong with the orbits themselves.

"We need to escalate," Marcus said. His voice had changed. Quieter. More careful. "This goes above verification."

"Escalate to who? We don't know what we're escalating."

"Doesn't matter. The system already ingested your report. It's already adjusting. If we don't get human oversight on this—"

He stopped. They both knew why.

The early-warning network was designed to move faster than human deliberation. That was the point. Orbital mechanics happened at eight kilometers per second. Conjunctions closed in minutes. Intercept windows lasted seconds. By the time a committee convened, the event was over.

So the system was authorized to act. To adjust posture. To recommend responses. To compress timelines when confidence degraded.

And confidence was degrading.

Nira checked the system status panel. The network health indicators were all green. Tracking coverage nominal. Processing latency nominal. Data quality metrics nominal. But underneath the green lights, the probability models were shifting. The conjunction predictions were tightening. The response thresholds were compressing.

The system was preparing for a world where things arrived early.

"It's not wrong," she said slowly. "The adjustment. If objects really are arriving early, then the system should account for that. It should compress the timelines."

"Unless the early arrival is an artifact of something we don't understand." Marcus pulled up the doctrinal reference. "The system optimizes for known failure modes. If we've given it a pattern that doesn't correspond to real orbital behavior—"

"Then it's preparing for threats that don't exist."

"Or threats that do exist but not for the reasons it thinks."

Nira stared at the status panel. All green. Everything working. The most sophisticated early-warning network ever built, learning from her input, adapting to her observations, trusting her judgment.

She had told it the truth. She had reported what the sensors showed. And now it was acting on that truth in ways she couldn't predict or control.

"The fix is worse than the fault," she said.

Marcus nodded. "That's why we escalate."

He initiated the protocol. Priority channel. Operations commander notification. The request would flag Colonel Chen's queue within minutes. Chen had the authority to pause system learning, to freeze the model weights, to put a human hand on the brake before the network optimized itself into a corner.

But pausing the system meant accepting degraded performance. It meant telling the network to ignore new data. It meant trusting the old model over the new observations.

And the old model didn't know that objects were arriving early.

Nira's console chirped. Another conjunction warning. She checked the timestamp against the predicted window.

Three point one seconds early.

The gap was widening.

"Marcus." She turned her screen toward him. "Look at the trend."

He looked. His face went pale.

The first anomaly she had flagged was 2.3 seconds. The system had found others at similar magnitudes. But this one—an LEO debris fragment and a defunct navigation satellite—showed more than three seconds of early arrival. And the objects involved were at higher altitude than the previous cases.

The pattern wasn't just present. It was growing.

"Pull the altitude regression," Marcus said.

She ran it. The correlation was 0.94. Nearly perfect linear relationship between orbital altitude and timing discrepancy. Objects at 400 kilometers showed sub-second anomalies. Objects at 800 kilometers showed two-second anomalies. Objects at 1,200 kilometers showed three seconds or more.

Whatever was causing this, it scaled with distance from Earth.

"This isn't clock error," Nira said. "This isn't sensor error. This is something physical."

"Something physical that makes orbits run fast." Marcus shook his head. "That's not how orbits work. You can't accelerate a Keplerian trajectory without adding energy. These are dead satellites. Debris. They're not thrusting."

"Then the clocks are wrong."

"All of them? ESA's and ours? GPS and ground reference? Every atomic standard on two continents?"

Nira didn't answer. There was no answer that made sense. Either the orbits were wrong, which violated conservation of energy, or the clocks were wrong, which violated the definition of time itself.

Both options were impossible.

Both options fit the data.

Her console chirped again. Not a conjunction warning this time. A system notification.

*Model update complete. Timing compensation applied to all conjunction predictions. Response thresholds adjusted per doctrine.*

The system had finished learning.

"How fast?" she asked.

Marcus checked the log. "Forty-three minutes from your initial submission to full network integration."

Forty-three minutes. Less than an hour. She had flagged an impossible observation, and the entire early-warning network had restructured itself to accommodate it. Every prediction. Every threshold. Every automated response pathway.

The system now believed that objects arrived early. It would act on that belief. It would compress warning windows. Tighten margins. Escalate faster.

And somewhere in the network, the operations commander was reading her escalation request, deciding whether to pause a system that had already made up its mind.

Colonel Chen's response arrived at 06:47.

*Escalation received. Convening working group at 08:00. System learning continues pending review.*

The system would not pause.

Nira stared at the message. Two hours until the working group convened. Two hours for the system to keep learning, keep adjusting, keep optimizing for a pattern that no one understood.

She checked the conjunction queue. Eighteen events predicted in the next two hours. The system would flag every one of them early. It would tighten every margin. It would trust her data, her observations, her judgment—even though she had no idea what she had observed.

The sensors weren't lying.

Neither was she.

But somewhere between the sensors and the predictions, between the observations and the model, something fundamental had broken. And the system was building itself around the break.

Another chirp. Another warning.

Three point four seconds early.

The gap was still widening.
