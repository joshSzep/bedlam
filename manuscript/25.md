# 25

The alarm had been screaming for eleven minutes.

Commander Vasquez floated in the node module, watching the conjunction queue scroll past on the display faster than she could read it. Seventeen predicted close approaches in the next six hours. Eight of them within the next ninety minutes. Three with overlapping time windows that made sequential response impossible.

The debris from Cosmos-1408 was everywhere.

"Hatch to Zvezda is sealed," Petrov reported over the intercom. His voice was calm—thirty years in space had taught him to sound calm—but she could hear the strain underneath. "All crew in shelter positions. Awaiting guidance."

Guidance. As if anyone knew what to do.

The shadow catalog feed was updating every thirty seconds now, each refresh adding new fragments to the tracking list. Fifteen hundred initial estimate had become nineteen hundred. The debris cloud was spreading, tumbling objects shedding smaller pieces as they collided with each other, each collision multiplying the threat.

"Houston, this is ISS. We have multiple conjunctions with overlapping TCAs. Request priority assessment."

A pause. Then: "ISS, Houston. We're working the problem. Stand by."

Stand by. The words that meant nobody knew.

"Moscow Control, ISS. Same request. Which threat do we address first?"

Another pause. Longer.

"ISS, Moscow. Our assessment differs from Houston. We recommend shelter for all events. Do not maneuver."

"Houston is recommending maneuver for conjunction delta-seven."

"Moscow assessment shows delta-seven as low probability. Recommend hold."

Two ground stations. Two predictions. Two versions of reality, even with the shadow catalog supposedly providing a unified reference. The timing schism hadn't disappeared—it had just moved from the data to the interpretation.

"Commander." That was Tanaka, at the tracking station. "The queue just updated. We have a new close approach. Object 1408-F-47. TCA in twenty-three minutes. Miss distance predicted at... forty-seven meters."

Forty-seven meters. Close enough to see. If there was anything to see—a tumbling chunk of Soviet-era satellite, invisible against the black until it was too late.

"What's the cross-section?"

"Unknown. Fragment size estimated between ten centimeters and half a meter. Could be a panel. Could be solid metal."

"And the approach vector?"

Tanaka checked. Her face went pale. "Directly toward the Columbus module. Solar array side."

The Vasquez Protocol. Rotate to minimize cross-section. It had worked once, against a single threat with known geometry. But this wasn't a single threat. This was a storm.

"If we rotate to protect Columbus," Vasquez said slowly, "we expose the Russian segment to the delta-seven conjunction."

"Yes."

"And if we rotate to protect the Russian segment—"

"We expose Columbus. And the solar arrays. And potentially the radiators."

There was no good angle. No orientation that protected everything. The station was too large, too awkwardly shaped, too vulnerable from too many directions.

"What about the crew?" DuPont asked. He was floating near the hatch to the European module, his home for the past three months. "If Columbus takes a strike—"

"We're not in Columbus. We're sheltered in Zvezda."

"The experiments. The equipment. Years of work—"

"Will have to survive on their own. Or not." Vasquez made the call. "We hold orientation. No rotation. Shelter in place for all conjunctions."

"That's not the protocol—"

"The protocol was designed for one threat. We have seventeen." She looked at the display. Twenty-one minutes to the first close approach. "The protocol doesn't scale."

The emergency coordination loop connected at 14:47 UTC.

Houston. Moscow. ESA Operations in Darmstadt. JAXA in Tsukuba. Four ground stations, four sets of controllers, all trying to manage a crisis that had spiraled beyond anyone's control.

"We need a unified response," the NASA flight director said. His name was Morrison, and he had the hollow look of someone who hadn't slept in days. "The crew can't respond to contradictory guidance."

"Then your guidance should align with physical reality," the Russian counterpart replied. His name was Volkov—not the shadow network Volkov, a different one, the irony lost on no one. "Our tracking shows—"

"Your tracking is calibrated to a timing regime we don't recognize. The shadow catalog—"

"The shadow catalog is Western propaganda dressed as science. We will not base operational decisions on criminal intelligence."

"The shadow catalog predicted your ASAT debris distribution with 94 percent accuracy. Your own ministry's projection was off by a factor of three."

"Enough." The ESA director cut in. She was German, efficient, exhausted. "We have crew in danger. Debate the politics later. What does the fused data show?"

A pause. Then Morrison pulled up the shadow catalog feed—the one that combined observations from all participating stations, including several that were contributing without their governments' knowledge.

"Object 1408-F-47. TCA in eighteen minutes. Miss distance 47 meters, confidence interval plus or minus 12 meters. If the object is on the low end of that interval, we have a potential strike. If it's on the high end, clean miss."

"Recommendation?"

"Hold. The maneuver fuel cost for a debris avoidance burn is significant. If we burn for every predicted close approach in the next six hours, we exhaust reserves. The station becomes uncontrollable."

"And if we hold and it hits?"

"Then we deal with the damage."

"That is not a plan," the Russian director said. "That is hope."

"Hope is all we have left. Your government made sure of that."

The silence on the loop was poisonous.

Nira watched the coordination loop from a conference room in the Geneva facility.

They had released her—technically—under armed supervision, with instructions to provide technical consultation on the shadow catalog outputs. The colonel had made the terms clear: help them interpret the data, or face prosecution for the crimes she'd already committed.

It wasn't freedom. But it was a view of the disaster.

"The conjunction queue is overwhelming them," Marcus said. He was beside her, similarly supervised, similarly trapped. "Even with perfect predictions, they can't respond to this many threats simultaneously."

"The predictions aren't perfect."

"No. But they're better than what the governments have on their own." He pointed at the display. "Look at the divergence. Houston's model and Moscow's model disagree by almost thirty meters on half the conjunctions. The shadow catalog is splitting the difference, but nobody trusts it enough to act on it alone."

"So they're paralyzed."

"They're doing what institutions do when the data conflicts. They're defaulting to procedure. And the procedure says shelter and hope."

Nira's phone buzzed. A message on the encrypted channel she wasn't supposed to have access to anymore.

*We can help. The fusion window is still running. If you can get us the station's real-time telemetry, we can tighten the predictions.*

Volkov. The shadow network. Still operating, still gathering data, still trying to build a version of reality that everyone could trust.

*I'm being monitored,* she typed back. *No access to feeds.*

*There might be another way. The ESA controllers are on the loop. Some of them are ours.*

She looked at the display. The ESA director, arguing with her counterparts about which predictions to trust. The controllers behind her, managing screens full of tracking data.

Some of them are ours.

The shadow network had infiltrated the response. Not through hacking or espionage—through recruitment. Through the slow accumulation of technical people who had decided that truth mattered more than institutional loyalty.

*What do you need?*

*Tell them to use the shadow catalog as primary reference. All stations. For the next hour. If they synchronize to our feed, we can generate conjunction predictions accurate enough to actually trust.*

*They won't do that. The Russians—*

*The Russians are already using it. Their controllers have been pulling shadow data for the last three hours. They just won't admit it publicly.*

Nira stared at the message. The Russians were using the shadow catalog. While their diplomats denounced it as propaganda. While their military created the debris that was threatening everyone.

The institutions were lying to each other even as their people collaborated in secret.

She typed her response. *I'll try.*

Then she stood and walked toward the ESA director.

Object 1408-F-47 passed the International Space Station at 15:05 UTC.

Miss distance: thirty-one meters.

Not a strike. But close enough that the radar return registered as a momentary spike on the station's sensors. Close enough that Commander Vasquez, floating in the shelter module, felt something she hadn't felt in her career: genuine uncertainty about whether she would survive the next hour.

"Clean miss," Tanaka reported. "But we have another conjunction in fourteen minutes. Object 1408-D-22. Different approach vector."

"How many more?"

"After that one? Six in the next two hours. Then a gap. Then another cluster."

The debris cloud was orbiting with them, around them, through them. The fragments spread across a range of altitudes and inclinations, each one following its own trajectory, each trajectory eventually intersecting with the station's path.

"Houston, ISS. Request status on emergency evacuation options."

"ISS, Houston. Dragon is being prepared for emergency undock. Soyuz is in position. We can begin evacuation if you assess the situation as untenable."

"What's untenable? We've had two close approaches in thirty minutes. We have six more coming. At what point do we leave?"

"That's... your call, Commander."

Her call. The decision to abandon a twenty-year international project, a hundred billion dollars of investment, humanity's only permanent presence in space. Her call.

"We hold," she said. "For now. Next conjunction in thirteen minutes. After that, we reassess."

---

Nira reached the ESA director during a brief pause in the coordination loop.

"Dr. Chandrasekaran." The director's name was Weber, and her expression said she knew exactly who Nira was and what she'd done. "I'm surprised they let you near an operational center."

"They need someone who understands the shadow catalog. That's me."

"The shadow catalog that's currently being investigated as an intelligence breach?"

"The shadow catalog that's the only source of conjunction predictions accurate enough to trust. Your controllers are already using it. So are the Russians, whether they admit it or not."

Weber's expression flickered. "How do you know that?"

"Because I helped build it. And I know who else is contributing." Nira lowered her voice. "The predictions can be better. More accurate. But only if all stations synchronize to the same reference. Right now, everyone's pulling shadow data independently, adjusting it with their own models, getting slightly different answers."

"You want us to formally adopt the shadow catalog."

"I want you to survive the next two hours. The station has six more conjunctions coming. Some of them are going to be close. If the predictions are off by even a few meters—"

"I know what happens if the predictions are off."

"Then use the tool that works. Publicly. All stations. Force Moscow and Houston to synchronize, even if they won't admit why. The physics doesn't care about politics. But the crew might die because of politics."

Weber was silent for a long moment. On the main display, the conjunction timer was counting down. Twelve minutes.

"I'll make the call," she said. "But if this goes wrong—"

"Then it goes wrong. But at least we'll know the truth about what happened."

---

The second conjunction was closer.

Object 1408-D-22 passed at 15:19 UTC, nineteen meters from the station's solar array. The fragment—a piece of Cosmos-1408's antenna structure, tumbling end over end—came close enough that ground-based radar lost track of it briefly, the signal masked by the station's own return.

And then it hit something.

Not the station. A piece of debris from the earlier Starlink cascade—a fragment that had drifted into the same orbital band, invisible on radar, unknown to any catalog.

The collision happened in silence, as all space collisions do. Two pieces of metal, each moving at seven kilometers per second in slightly different directions, intersecting for a fraction of a millisecond.

The result was visible on tracking screens across the world.

COLLISION DETECTED
Objects: 1408-D-22 / Unknown (Starlink debris probable)
Location: 412 km altitude, 51.6° inclination
Time: 15:19:23 UTC
Fragments generated: Estimated 200+ (tracking in progress)

Two hundred new fragments. In the same orbital band as the ISS. Spreading outward from a point less than twenty meters from the station.

"We need to leave," Tanaka said. Her voice was steady, but her hands were shaking. "Commander. We need to leave now."

Vasquez looked at the tracking display. The new debris cloud was expanding, the fragments diverging at different rates, some of them already crossing the station's projected path.

The sky was hunting them.

"Evacuation stations," she said. "All crew to spacecraft. Now."

---

Nira watched the collision alert flash across the coordination loop.

Two hundred fragments. The cascade was accelerating. Every collision created more debris, and more debris created more collisions. The mathematics of exponential growth, playing out in real time.

"They're evacuating," Marcus said quietly.

"I know."

"If they leave, the station is lost. There's no way to maintain it remotely for long. It'll decay, reenter, burn up."

"I know."

"Twenty years of international cooperation. The only thing all the space programs ever agreed to build together. Gone because someone decided to prove a point."

Nira didn't respond. There was nothing to say.

On the display, the evacuation timeline appeared. Dragon undock in forty-five minutes. Soyuz undock in sixty. Transfer orbits calculated. Reentry windows projected.

The crew would survive. Probably. If nothing else hit them in the next hour.

But the station—humanity's foothold in space, the symbol of what people could accomplish when they worked together—would be abandoned. Left to drift, to decay, to fall.

Her phone buzzed one more time.

*We have the tracking data from the collision. The fragment cascade is worse than projected. Kessler onset is now estimated at 72 hours for the 400-420 km band.*

Seventy-two hours. Three days until the orbital environment became self-sustaining chaos. Until every satellite in that band was at risk. Until the debris generated more debris faster than it could decay.

*What can we do?*

*Nothing. Watch. Document. Make sure the truth survives.*

Nira looked at the evacuation countdown. Forty-three minutes.

She thought about everything she'd done. The crimes. The betrayals. The desperate attempt to tell the truth in a world that didn't want to hear it.

The truth had mattered. The shadow catalog had changed the ASAT target, saved the GPS constellation, given the crew warning. But it hadn't been enough. The cascade continued. The sky was falling.

And all she could do was watch.

EVACUATION COUNTDOWN: 42:17
NEXT CONJUNCTION CLUSTER: 8 minutes
KESSLER THRESHOLD: 72 hours

The clocks kept running.

The universe didn't wait for anyone to catch up.
