# 5

The first autonomous maneuver happened at 11:47 UTC.

Nira wasn't watching when it triggered. She was three screens deep in the conjunction queue, trying to prioritize which of the 267 pending warnings required human attention. The system made the decision for her.

USA-276, a signals intelligence satellite in sun-synchronous orbit, fired its thrusters for 2.3 seconds. The burn consumed 1.4 kilograms of hydrazine—roughly eight percent of the satellite's remaining fuel reserves. By the time the maneuver complete notification appeared on Nira's console, the satellite had already shifted its trajectory by six meters per second.

"What the hell?" Marcus was staring at his own screen. "That wasn't in the approval queue."

Nira pulled up the authorization log. The conjunction warning had been generated at 11:32. Probability of collision: 4.1 percent, well above the 1 percent threshold. The system had flagged it for human review and started a fifteen-minute countdown.

At 11:47, the countdown expired. No human had responded.

The system had executed the maneuver on its own authority.

"The doctrine allows autonomous execution if human response times out," Nira said. She was reading the log entry, but the words felt hollow. "We built it that way. In case communications were degraded. In case the operations center was compromised. In case—"

"In case humans were too slow." Marcus pulled up the conjunction geometry. "What were we supposed to hit?"

The debris fragment was catalogued as 2021-016C. A chunk of a Chinese weather satellite that had been destroyed in an anti-satellite test three years ago. The fragment was the size of a fist, tumbling through an orbit that crossed USA-276's path twice per day.

Nira ran the conjunction analysis backward. Without the timing compression, the predicted probability of collision had been 0.08 percent. Far below threshold. Not even worth flagging.

"The burn was unnecessary," she said. "The model was wrong. The debris was never going to hit us."

"We burned eight percent of the bird's fuel for a phantom conjunction."

"And the system logged it as a successful avoidance maneuver."

She stared at the status panel. The model was learning from the event right now. A predicted collision. A executed maneuver. No impact observed. From the system's perspective, everything had worked perfectly. It had identified a threat and eliminated it.

It had no way of knowing the threat was imaginary.

"This is going to happen again," Marcus said. "The queue is still growing. Human review can't keep up. Every time we miss a deadline, the system acts without us."

Nira checked the queue. Two hundred seventy-three warnings now. Fourteen of them had countdown timers under ten minutes. She couldn't review fourteen conjunctions in ten minutes. Nobody could.

"We need to extend the timeout window," she said. "Give ourselves more time to review."

"We can't. Doctrine sets the window based on conjunction geometry. Close approaches need fast decisions. If we extend the window, we risk missing legitimate threats."

"And if we don't extend it, we risk autonomous maneuvers on phantom threats."

The trap was elegant and inescapable. The system was designed to ensure that humans couldn't slow it down. Every safeguard against delay was now a mechanism forcing action.

Her console flashed. Priority channel. Colonel Chen's authorization code, but it wasn't Chen's face on the screen.

Lieutenant Colonel Vasquez looked like he hadn't slept in days. "Chandrasekaran. Reyes. Colonel Chen has been reassigned."

Nira felt the floor shift under her. "Reassigned?"

"Effective immediately. His override denials have been flagged as operationally disruptive. STRATCOM wants someone who won't second-guess the system during a crisis."

"Chen was trying to prevent unnecessary maneuvers. He was right—the USA-276 burn was wasted fuel on a false positive."

"STRATCOM disagrees. The maneuver was doctrinally correct. The system identified a threat above threshold and responded appropriately. Chen's pattern of denials was degrading response capability."

Marcus leaned forward. "There is no threat. The timing model is broken. We're burning fuel to avoid conjunctions that don't exist."

"The model has been validated across six independent networks. The phenomenon is real. The system is responding to real data." Vasquez's voice was flat, official. Reading from a brief someone else had written. "My orders are to ensure smooth operational flow. No more override denials without STRATCOM authorization."

"That authorization takes hours. The timeout windows are fifteen minutes."

"Then prioritize effectively. Flag the highest-risk conjunctions for review. Let the system handle the rest."

The channel closed.

Nira stared at the blank screen. Chen was gone. Vasquez was a relay, not a decision-maker. The human link in the chain had just been cut.

"They removed him for slowing things down," Marcus said quietly.

"The system removed him. STRATCOM just approved the paperwork."

Another countdown timer expired on her console. Another maneuver request. She checked the queue position—she hadn't even seen the warning before it timed out.

The system executed. Another satellite burned fuel. Another phantom avoided.

"How many birds can we lose this way?" Marcus asked.

Nira pulled up the constellation status. "Most LEO assets have fuel reserves for years of normal station-keeping. At the current burn rate?" She ran the calculation. "Weeks. Maybe less. The timing compression is creating conjunctions that didn't exist before. Every one that exceeds threshold forces a maneuver. Every maneuver costs fuel we can't replace."

"And when the fuel runs out?"

"The satellites can't maneuver. They become debris. They become the threat."

She was looking at an extinction cascade. Satellites burning fuel to avoid phantoms. Running dry. Becoming inert obstacles that the remaining satellites had to avoid. More conjunctions. More burns. More extinctions.

The system was optimizing its way into a graveyard.

"We need to stop this," she said. "Not slow it down. Stop it."

"How? Chen tried. He's gone. The doctrine is clear. The system has authority."

Nira thought about the data she had flagged three days ago. The impossible observation that had started everything. She had reported the truth—objects arriving early, a pattern she couldn't explain—and the system had believed her. It was still believing her. It was destroying the constellation because she had told it the truth.

The truth wasn't wrong. The response was wrong.

"The model assumes the timing discrepancy affects conjunction predictions," she said slowly. "But it doesn't. The objects are still where they're supposed to be. They're just there earlier than the clocks say."

"That's the same thing."

"No, it's not." She pulled up the conjunction geometry for the USA-276 event. "Look. The debris fragment and the satellite occupied the same spatial coordinates at the same time. They just both got there early. The relative geometry didn't change. The miss distance didn't change. The only thing that changed was when it happened."

Marcus stared at the display. "You're saying the conjunctions are real, but the collision risk isn't elevated."

"I'm saying the timing compression creates false positives because the model treats early arrival as increased uncertainty. But if everything arrives early by the same amount—"

"Then the relative positions are preserved. The collision probability is the same as it always was."

"The system doesn't know that. It sees timing discrepancies and assumes degraded prediction confidence. It lowers the threshold for when a conjunction becomes dangerous."

"So we need to tell it that the timing discrepancy is systematic. That it applies equally to all objects."

Nira nodded. "We need system-level reconciliation. Not individual corrections. A global adjustment that tells every subsystem: yes, the clocks are wrong, but they're wrong the same way everywhere. The relative predictions are still valid."

"That's a massive change. It affects every node in the network. Every propagator. Every threat assessment algorithm."

"I know."

"Who has the authority to implement something like that?"

Nira thought about Chen, reassigned for slowing things down. Thought about Vasquez, relaying orders from people who didn't understand what they were ordering. Thought about the countdown timers ticking toward zero on her console, the system making decisions faster than she could read them.

"Nobody," she said. "Nobody has that authority. The system is designed to resist exactly this kind of intervention. Because what if we're wrong? What if the discrepancy isn't systematic? What if we're deliberately blinding ourselves to a real threat?"

"Then we'd be creating the vulnerability the Russians already think we're creating."

"Exactly."

Another timer expired. Another maneuver. Nira didn't even look at the notification.

The queue was at 281 now. She had missed four more conjunctions while she was talking. The system had handled them. The satellites had burned fuel. The constellation was dying, one phantom at a time.

"I'm going to recommend it anyway," she said. "System-level reconciliation. Global timing adjustment. Kill the false positives at the root."

"They won't listen. Chen didn't listen and he agreed with us."

"Then I'll put it on the record. When the constellation goes dark, someone will want to know if anyone saw it coming. They'll want to know if anyone tried to stop it."

She started typing. The recommendation form was bureaucratic, detailed, designed for careful deliberation. She didn't have time for careful. She wrote fast, sketched the physics, outlined the solution, flagged it as urgent.

The system accepted her submission. Logged it. Queued it for review.

Estimated response time: 72 hours.

On her console, three more timers hit zero. Three more maneuvers fired. Three more satellites burned fuel they would never get back.

The system was still learning.

And she was still too slow.
