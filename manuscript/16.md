# 16

They called it Protocol Seventeen.

Nira learned about it through the same laptop they had used to write their testimony. Someone had restored limited network access—not to the operational systems, but to the policy feeds. The dry bureaucratic channels where doctrine was debated and revised.

Protocol Seventeen: Interim Guidelines for Human-Supervised Conjunction Response.

She read it three times. The language was careful, hedged, full of escape clauses and liability shields. But underneath the bureaucratic armor, she could see the shape of what they had argued for.

No autonomous maneuvers for assets with less than ten percent fuel reserves.

Extended review windows for conjunctions involving national security payloads.

Regional command authority for collision avoidance decisions, replacing centralized automation.

Human sign-off required for any maneuver exceeding mission-critical fuel thresholds.

"They listened," Marcus said. He was reading over her shoulder. "Sort of."

"They created a framework for listening. Whether they actually follow it..." Nira scrolled through the implementation notes. "The protocol is advisory. Commanders can override it in emergencies."

"Everything is an emergency now."

"That's the problem."

A notification chimed on the laptop. Priority traffic on the operations channel—someone had added them to the distribution list. Nira opened it and felt her stomach drop.

CONJUNCTION ALERT - CRITICAL PRIORITY
Assets: ISS (International Space Station) / Debris Fragment 2024-019B
Predicted CPA: 14:47:22 UTC
Miss Distance (Current Model): 847 meters
Confidence Interval: ±2,100 meters
Timing Uncertainty: 4.7 seconds

The International Space Station.

"The confidence interval is larger than the predicted miss distance," Marcus said. "The model doesn't know if this is a hit or a safe pass."

"That's what four-point-seven seconds of timing uncertainty does. At orbital velocity, that's forty kilometers of along-track ambiguity."

The alert continued scrolling. Recommended action: debris avoidance maneuver, 1.2 m/s delta-v. Fuel cost: negligible for ISS. Risk assessment: ELEVATED.

"This is a test," Nira said. "The first real application of Protocol Seventeen. Do they maneuver based on a prediction they know is unreliable, or do they hold and accept the risk?"

"ISS isn't a satellite they can afford to lose."

"No. But the maneuver costs attitude control propellant. Every burn shortens the station's operational life." She pulled up the ISS status. "They're already below nominal reserves from the last two weeks of increased activity. If they maneuver every time the model flags uncertainty—"

"They'll run out of fuel before the debris cascade ends."

"If it ever ends."

The operations channel updated. A voice call was being convened—decision-makers from NASA, Space Command, the ISS program office, international partners. The conjunction was two hours away. They had two hours to decide.

Someone had included Nira and Marcus as observers on the call. No speaking privileges, but they could listen.

"We're watching," Marcus said quietly. "That's our role now."

"Watching them implement what we argued for. And hoping we weren't wrong."

The call connected. A mosaic of video feeds appeared on the screen—faces in different locations, different time zones, different institutional affiliations. All of them focused on the same problem.

A NASA official was speaking. "—confidence interval makes the current prediction effectively useless. We can't distinguish between a close pass and a potential impact."

"The system recommends maneuver." A military voice, clipped and precise. "Standard protocol would be to execute."

"Standard protocol was suspended under Protocol Seventeen. The guidance says we extend review windows and require human sign-off for high-uncertainty events."

"This is the International Space Station. We can't apply fuel-conservation logic to a crewed asset."

"We're not applying fuel-conservation logic. We're applying uncertainty logic. The model doesn't know where the debris will be. The maneuver might move us into the threat instead of away from it."

Nira watched the argument unfold. Both sides were right. Both sides were scared. The timing uncertainty had made prediction meaningless, and they were trying to decide whether to act on meaningless data or to accept meaningless risk.

"What's the debris?" someone asked. "Where did it come from?"

"Fragment from the 2024-019 event. Chinese resupply vehicle that broke up during reentry. We've been tracking it for eight months."

"Tracking it with what confidence?"

A pause. "Tracking confidence has degraded significantly over the past week. The timing anomaly has affected all our predictions for this debris field."

"So we don't actually know where it is."

"We know approximately where it is. Within the confidence interval."

"The confidence interval that's larger than the miss distance."

Another pause. Nira could feel the weight of the decision pressing down on everyone in the call.

Marcus leaned toward the laptop. "They're going to maneuver. They have to. It's the ISS."

"Maybe. But look at the math." Nira pulled up a side calculation. "If they maneuver based on this prediction, they're moving to avoid a debris position that might not be correct. The timing uncertainty means the debris could be anywhere along a forty-kilometer track. The maneuver might put them closer to the actual position."

"And if they don't maneuver and the debris is where the model predicts?"

"Then they get hit. Or they don't. We won't know until it happens."

The call continued. More arguments. More data. More uncertainty wrapped in technical language.

Finally, a senior voice cut through. "We're going to hold."

Silence.

"The Protocol Seventeen guidance is clear. Human sign-off is required for high-uncertainty maneuvers. I'm the human in the loop, and I'm not signing off. The prediction doesn't give us enough confidence to justify the fuel expenditure."

"If we're wrong—"

"If we're wrong, we'll have two minutes of warning from the close approach radar. That's enough time to shelter the crew in the hardened modules. It's not enough time to execute a maneuver anyway." The voice was steady. "We're holding position. Log my authorization."

The call devolved into logistics—crew notification, shelter procedures, public affairs preparation. Nira muted the audio and sat back.

"They chose," she said.

"They chose to accept the risk." Marcus was staring at the screen. "Four astronauts and three cosmonauts on that station. They just decided to let them roll the dice instead of trusting the model."

"The model isn't trustworthy. That's the whole point."

"I know. But this is what it feels like when humans choose instead of machines. It feels like gambling with lives."

Nira didn't respond. He was right. The clean logic of her arguments—withdrawal, acceptance, human judgment—looked different when it was applied to seven people in a tin can circling the Earth.

The clock counted down. Two hours. Then one. Then thirty minutes.

The laptop showed the conjunction geometry updating in real time. Miss distance estimates fluctuating as new tracking data came in. 900 meters. 750 meters. 1,100 meters. The numbers jumped around, reflecting the uncertainty that made prediction meaningless.

At fourteen minutes to closest approach, an alert flashed.

NEW TRACKING DATA - CONFIDENCE UPDATE
Miss Distance (Revised): 2,340 meters
Confidence Interval: ±890 meters

The debris was further away than predicted. The timing uncertainty had biased the original estimate. If they had maneuvered, they would have moved toward the actual debris position.

"They were right," Marcus said. "The hold was correct."

"This time."

The conjunction passed without incident. The ISS continued its orbit. Seven people continued breathing.

The operations channel erupted with relief—cautious, professional, but unmistakable. Someone had made a call that contradicted the system's recommendation, and it had worked.

Protocol Seventeen had survived its first test.

But Nira felt no relief. She was looking at another feed that had appeared on the laptop during the ISS drama.

COMMERCIAL OPERATOR NOTIFICATION
Starlink Constellation - Autonomous Maneuver Event
Assets Affected: 247 satellites
Total Delta-V Expended: 891 m/s aggregate
Cause: System response to elevated conjunction predictions

Two hundred forty-seven Starlink satellites had maneuvered simultaneously. While everyone was focused on the ISS, the commercial constellation had followed its own automation. Burning fuel. Responding to predictions corrupted by the same timing uncertainty.

SpaceX didn't have Protocol Seventeen. Their system still optimized.

"The commercial operators," Nira said. "They're not following the new guidelines."

Marcus looked at the notification. "They can't. The Starlink constellation is too large for human-supervised maneuvers. They have to automate or they can't function."

"Then they'll burn through their fuel reserves faster than anyone."

"And when they run out?"

"Four thousand satellites become four thousand pieces of debris."

The number hung in the air. The Starlink constellation was the largest single orbital presence in history. If it failed—if the automated systems drove it to exhaustion—the debris cascade would become unstoppable.

"We need to tell them," Marcus said. "Share the Protocol Seventeen framework. Help them implement human review—"

"They won't listen. SpaceX optimizes for uptime. Their business model requires automated response. If they slow down, they lose revenue. If they lose revenue, they can't launch replacements. The whole system collapses."

"Then the whole system collapses anyway. Just more slowly with the automation, and all at once when the fuel runs out."

Nira was about to respond when another notification appeared. This one wasn't from the operations channel.

BREAKING - REUTERS
Chinese Ministry of Defense: "Recent orbital anomalies consistent with deliberate interference"
Statement demands international investigation into "weaponization of space timing infrastructure"

The Chinese government was going public.

Nira opened the full article. The statement accused unnamed parties of manipulating timing references to degrade Chinese orbital surveillance capabilities. It cited the fragmentation events, the coordination failures, the international data-sharing cutoffs as evidence of hostile action.

"They're blaming us," Marcus said. "Specifically us. The timing attack narrative."

"They're blaming everyone. Or no one in particular." Nira read further. "They're using the crisis to justify something."

The article continued. In response to the alleged interference, China was accelerating deployment of its backup constellation. Thirty satellites scheduled for emergency launch within the week. A new orbital architecture designed to operate independently of international timing standards.

"They're not just blaming," she said. "They're building. A parallel system. One that doesn't depend on coordination with anyone else."

"That's the worst possible response. More satellites means more conjunction potential. More independent systems means more conflicting predictions. More conflicting predictions means more unnecessary maneuvers—"

"Means more debris. Means faster cascade. Yes." Nira closed the article. "Everyone is responding rationally to their own fears. And every rational response makes the collective situation worse."

The laptop chimed again. Another priority notification.

PROTOCOL SEVENTEEN UPDATE - EMERGENCY REVISION
Effective Immediately: Human sign-off requirements suspended for military assets during DEFCON 2 operations.
Rationale: National security priorities require automated response capability.
Authorization: STRATCOM / NRO Joint Directive

The protocol had lasted four hours.

Nira stared at the notification. The framework they had fought for, the human-supervised approach that had just saved the ISS—gutted before the conjunction debris had finished its orbit.

"They took it back," Marcus said.

"They never really gave it. The ISS decision was civilian. NASA. International partners. The moment it threatened military automation, they walked it back."

"So we're back where we started."

"No. We're somewhere worse." Nira pulled up the system status. "Now there are two doctrines. Civilian assets under Protocol Seventeen—human review, extended windows, accepted uncertainty. Military assets under the old automation—immediate response, optimized maneuvers, fuel burning."

"That's incoherent. The same debris threatens both. The same timing uncertainty affects both."

"But different systems respond to the same threat differently. The military satellites will maneuver when civilians hold. They'll create new conjunction risks. They'll burn fuel that changes the debris environment for everyone." She felt something cold settling into her chest. "The fragmentation we caused—the six clusters—that was temporary. This is permanent. Two parallel doctrines, two incompatible responses, both running simultaneously."

"Can they fix it? Reconcile the approaches?"

"That would require admitting that one of them is wrong. The military won't admit their automation is broken. The civilians won't accept full automation after the ISS decision worked." Nira closed the laptop. "We didn't unify the response. We split it."

Marcus was quiet for a long moment.

"There's something else," he said finally.

"What?"

"The timing anomaly. I've been thinking about it while you were focused on the policy feeds." He pulled out a tablet—his own device, separate from the shared laptop. "The altitude correlation. The scaling with orbital distance. I think I understand what it means."

Nira looked at him. This was new. Marcus had been her partner in sabotage, her witness, her co-author. But he hadn't claimed to understand the physics. Neither of them had.

"Tell me."

"It's not that time is wrong at orbital altitudes. It's that our definition of simultaneity assumes a flat reference frame. A single, consistent 'now' that extends everywhere." He showed her a diagram on the tablet—rough, hand-drawn, but clear. "But what if the reference frame isn't flat? What if there's curvature we didn't account for? Small enough to ignore at surface distances, but significant at orbital scales?"

"General relativity already accounts for gravitational curvature."

"Gravitational curvature, yes. But what if there's something else? A temporal gradient that isn't gravitational?" Marcus's eyes were intense. "I'm not saying I know what causes it. I'm saying the pattern fits. The scaling with altitude. The consistency across all observations. It's not random error. It's systematic. Like a field."

"A temporal field."

"Or something that affects time like a field affects charge. Something we've never measured because we never had systems sensitive enough to detect it."

Nira considered this. It was speculation—wild, unsupported, probably wrong. But it was also the first hypothesis she had heard that matched the data without requiring broken clocks or violated physics.

"If you're right," she said slowly, "then no amount of calibration will fix the predictions. The discrepancy isn't error. It's measurement."

"We're measuring something real. Something that was always there. We just couldn't see it until our systems got precise enough."

"And now that we see it, we can't un-see it."

"No. We can only decide what to do with it."

The laptop chimed again. Another notification. Another crisis demanding attention.

Nira ignored it for a moment. She was looking at Marcus's diagram, at the rough sketch of something that might explain everything—or might explain nothing.

"We need to share this," she said. "Not as a solution. As a framework. A way of understanding what's happening that doesn't blame anyone."

"Will they listen?"

"Probably not. But it needs to be said. It needs to be on the record." She picked up the laptop again, opened their testimony document. "Add it. Write what you just told me. Even if no one believes it now, someone might later."

Marcus nodded. He started typing.

Outside their basement room, the orbital environment continued to degrade. Two doctrines competed. Commercial systems burned fuel while military systems burned fuel while civilian systems tried to hold. China prepared to launch thirty new satellites into an already crowded sky.

And somewhere in the physics—in the fabric of time itself—something they didn't understand continued to make prediction impossible.

They had crossed into a new phase.

Not the phase of crisis, but the phase of adaptation.

The world was learning to live with broken time.

It was learning badly.

But it was learning.
