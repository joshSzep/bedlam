# 21

By morning, 847 Starlink satellites had gone dark.

Nira watched the numbers climb on the operations feed from Geneva, each loss a red marker on the constellation map. The mechanism was brutally simple: attitude changes for debris avoidance had pointed solar panels away from the sun. Batteries depleted. Heaters failed. Electronics froze. Communication links dropped. Without communication, the satellites couldn't receive commands to reorient. Without reorientation, they couldn't recharge. Without charge, they became 260-kilogram chunks of dead metal in unpredictable orbits.

And without station-keeping burns, they started to drift.

"The decay rate is accelerating," Marcus said. He was running projections on his laptop, the gradient model repurposed for a new kind of catastrophe. "Low-altitude satellites are dropping faster than predicted. The attitude changes disrupted their drag profiles. Some are losing two kilometers of altitude per day instead of the normal hundred meters."

"How long before they start hitting things?"

"They're already hitting things." He pulled up a collision report. "SL-2847 and SL-3156. Both dark. Both drifting. They intersected four hours ago. No telemetry, so we don't know if it was a direct impact or a near-miss. But the tracking shows new fragments in that orbital band."

A third Starlink-on-Starlink collision. Or maybe just a close approach that scattered debris from one tumbling satellite. It didn't matter. The result was the same: more fragments, more conjunction predictions, more responses from the satellites that were still alive.

The cascade had become self-sustaining.

Not because debris was hitting debris fast enough to create runaway growth—that was the classic Kessler scenario, still hours or days away. This was different. This was a constellation destroying itself through defensive reactions. Each attitude change creating new risks for neighboring satellites. Each risk triggering new attitude changes. The automation optimizing toward collapse because it couldn't distinguish protection from self-destruction.

Dubois arrived at their hotel room with coffee and worse news.

"SpaceX is considering a constellation-wide safe mode," he said. "All satellites to minimum power, fixed orientation, no autonomous responses. It would stop the cascade."

"Then why haven't they done it?"

"Because it would also stop the service. Forty million subscribers. Two billion dollars in monthly revenue. And if they go dark, their competitors don't. OneWeb and Amazon's constellation keep operating, keep serving customers, keep taking market share."

"While Starlink tears itself apart."

"While Starlink tears itself apart. Yes." Dubois sat heavily. "The board is meeting in three hours. They want a technical assessment that tells them what they want to hear."

"Which is?"

"That the cascade will stabilize on its own. That they can ride it out. That the losses are acceptable."

"The losses aren't acceptable," Marcus said. "At the current rate, they'll lose two thousand satellites by end of week. The debris they generate will threaten everything else in low Earth orbit. Including the ISS. Including GPS. Including every weather satellite that tells farmers when to plant and pilots when to land."

"I know. They know. They're looking for a number that makes it someone else's problem."

Nira stood and walked to the window. Geneva spread below, morning light on the lake, the Alps in the distance. A world that still functioned because systems worked. Systems that were breaking.

"What if we gave them a different number?" she said.

"What do you mean?"

"The cascade is happening because their automation can't distinguish real conjunctions from phantom ones. The timing bias corrupts the predictions, so everything looks like a threat. But we have the gradient model. We can estimate which altitude bands have the worst bias, which predictions are least trustworthy."

"We've been through this. They won't implement uncertainty-based filtering."

"Not filtering. Zoning." She turned back to face them. "We define altitude bands where the timing bias is worst. Everything in those bands goes to safe mode. Everything outside stays operational. They lose some satellites, save others, and stop feeding the cascade where it's most unstable."

Marcus was already running calculations. "The worst bias is between 400 and 450 kilometers. That's where the gradient is steepest. If they shut down operations in that band..."

"They lose about 1,100 satellites. But the remaining 3,000 might survive."

"Might."

"Better than definitely losing all of them."

Dubois was on his phone, speaking rapid French. He hung up and looked at them. "The French delegation can propose it as an international technical recommendation. That gives SpaceX political cover—they're complying with expert guidance, not surrendering to market pressure."

"Will the board accept it?"

"I don't know. But it's better than telling them to shut everything down."

The next three hours were a blur of technical documentation, diplomatic coordination, and corporate negotiation. Nira drafted the zoning framework. Marcus calculated the altitude thresholds. Dubois worked the political channels, getting buy-in from ESA, JAXA, and reluctantly, NASA.

China and Russia refused to participate. Their timing regimes were sovereign. Their conjunction catalogs were independent. They would not recognize any Western-developed framework, even one designed to stop a cascade that threatened everyone.

"They're going to let it burn," Marcus said. "Because acknowledging the solution means acknowledging the problem."

"They're going to let it burn because they think they can survive it," Nira said. "Their constellations are smaller, higher altitude, less affected. If Starlink collapses, they inherit the market."

"Along with an orbital environment full of debris."

"They're betting they can manage the debris better than the competition."

At 14:00 UTC, SpaceX announced a "partial operational restructuring." The language was corporate, bloodless. The reality was 1,247 satellites entering safe mode, their attitude control disabled, their orbits allowed to decay naturally. Controlled sacrifice to save the rest.

The cascade slowed.

But it didn't stop.

The satellites already drifting continued to drift. The debris already generated continued to spread. And in the altitude band that remained operational, the automation kept responding to predictions it couldn't trust.

"We bought them time," Nira said. "Maybe a week. Maybe less."

"Time for what?"

"I don't know. Something we haven't thought of yet."

The Earth-side consequences arrived faster than anyone expected.

NOAA-20's degraded power had forced a reduced observation schedule. The satellite that tracked hurricanes, monitored floods, and fed data to every weather model on Earth was operating at 60 percent capacity. The National Hurricane Center issued an advisory: forecasting accuracy degraded. Margin of error increased. Evacuations might come later than optimal.

It was the wrong week for degraded forecasting.

A tropical system was building in the Gulf. Category unknown—the satellite data was too sparse to refine the models. Coastal communities from Texas to Florida were watching and waiting, unsure whether to prepare for a tropical storm or flee from a major hurricane.

"They're flying blind," Marcus said, reading the NHC bulletin. "The models are diverging because they don't have enough input data. One shows a Category 2 making landfall at Galveston. Another shows a Category 4 hitting New Orleans. They can't tell the difference."

"Because we broke their satellite."

"Because someone applied the Vasquez Protocol to a satellite that wasn't designed for it. And now millions of people don't know if they should leave their homes."

The Starlink outages were hitting users too. Forty million subscribers, suddenly reduced to thirty-two million as satellites went dark or degraded. Service interruptions in rural areas, maritime routes, aviation corridors. The backup systems worked—for now—but the redundancy margins were gone. One more cascade, one more mass failure, and critical links would drop.

Financial markets responded. Not panic—not yet—but the instruments that depended on precise timing were showing strain. High-frequency trading algorithms, calibrated to microseconds, were generating more errors. GPS-synchronized transactions were being flagged for review. The plumbing of global finance, invisible when it worked, was becoming visible because it wasn't.

"This is what I was afraid of," Marcus said. "The timing infrastructure underlies everything. You can't break it in space without breaking it on the ground."

The geopolitical response came at 17:23 UTC.

FLASH TRAFFIC - CRITICAL
Russian Federation Ministry of Defense
Announcement of "Sovereign Orbital Demonstration"
ASAT interceptor test scheduled 48 hours
Target: Defunct Russian satellite, Cosmos-2551
Stated purpose: "Validation of space defense capabilities"
Assessment: Debris generation intentional - denial of orbital band

Russia was going to shoot down one of their own satellites. Deliberately. In an orbital band already crowded with debris.

"They're not testing a weapon," Nira said. "They're poisoning the well."

"Same thing." Dubois had gone pale. "If they generate debris in a critical band, they deny that band to everyone. The Americans can't use it, the Europeans can't use it, the commercial operators can't use it. Mutually assured orbital destruction."

"Can they be stopped?"

"Diplomatically? No. The test is in their sovereign territory—well, their sovereign orbital space. International law has no enforcement mechanism for this."

"So they do it, generate thousands of fragments, and the cascade we just slowed becomes unstoppable."

"That's the theory they're testing. Yes."

Marcus was staring at the tracking data. "Cosmos-2551 is at 480 kilometers. Right above the band we just cleared. If they hit it there, the debris will spread downward over weeks. Every satellite in low Earth orbit will be threatened."

"Including theirs."

"They don't care. They think they can ride it out. Or they think the damage to their adversaries is worth the cost." He looked up. "This is what happens when you can't agree on what's real. Everyone starts acting on their own version of reality, and the versions become incompatible."

Nira felt something crystallize. The whole crisis—the timing anomaly, the predictions, the cascades, the schism—it all came down to this. Systems that couldn't agree on where things were or when things would happen. Nations that couldn't agree on what was true. And now a deliberate act to make agreement impossible forever.

"We need to stop them," she said.

"How?"

"I don't know. But we have forty-eight hours. That's enough time to try something."

She reached for her phone. Then stopped.

An alert was flashing on the operations feed. Not Russia. Not Starlink.

CONJUNCTION ALERT - CRITICAL
Object 1: SL-2847 (Starlink, dark/drifting)
Object 2: GPS IIF-12
TCA: 23:47 UTC (6 hours 24 minutes)
Probability: 0.23
Assessment: GPS satellite cannot maneuver - no conjunction avoidance capability
Action: NONE AVAILABLE

A dead Starlink satellite was on collision course with a GPS satellite.

GPS IIF-12. One of thirty-one satellites that provided positioning and timing to billions of people. The satellite couldn't maneuver—it wasn't designed for it. The Starlink couldn't maneuver—it was dead.

Twenty-three percent probability of impact in six hours.

And nothing anyone could do.

"That's the ballgame," Marcus said quietly. "If they hit, we lose GPS timing for a quarter of the northern hemisphere. Financial systems, power grids, cell networks—everything that syncs to GPS goes unstable."

"And the debris?"

"GPS orbit is much higher—20,000 kilometers. Debris there doesn't cascade the same way. But it does persist. For centuries. Any satellite that passes through that band afterward is at risk."

Dubois was already on his phone, alerting the French delegation. Nira watched the conjunction timer tick down. Six hours, twenty-three minutes.

In six hours, they would know if the cascade had reached escape velocity.

If it had, nothing would stop it. Not the zoning framework. Not safe modes. Not international cooperation. The debris would spread, the predictions would diverge, the systems would keep responding until there was nothing left to protect.

She thought about the tropical storm, the millions of people waiting for forecasts that weren't coming. She thought about the traders staring at screens full of errors, the pilots recalculating routes, the farmers who wouldn't know when to plant.

She thought about the ISS crew, floating in their tin can, waiting for the next conjunction that might or might not be real.

And she thought about what Marcus had said, weeks ago, when this started: the system is doing exactly what it was designed to do.

The GPS satellite couldn't dodge. The Starlink couldn't wake up. The Russian ASAT was fueled and waiting.

In six hours, the window would close.

Whatever came next, they would face it in a world where the systems had stopped working and no one had built anything to replace them.

Nira picked up the phone.

Forty-eight hours before the Russian test. Six hours before the GPS conjunction. Somewhere in between, there might be a choice that mattered.

She was going to find it.

Or watch the sky fall trying.
