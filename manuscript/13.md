# 13

The tablet stopped updating at 03:14.

Nira stared at the frozen screen, waiting for it to refresh, waiting for the next cascade of alerts and status changes and evidence of a world tearing itself apart. But the data feeds had gone silent. Not empty—frozen. The last timestamp hung in the corner like an epitaph.

"They cut our access," Marcus said. He was looking at his own dead tablet. "Completely this time."

"Or the system deprioritized us." Nira set the tablet down on the table. "We're not actionable anymore. Just two flagged analysts in a basement, watching numbers they can't change."

The room felt smaller now. The same concrete walls, the same fluorescent lights, the same camera blinking in the corner. But without the data feeds, without the constant stream of information connecting them to the crisis above, the space had contracted into something like a coffin.

They had been awake for—how long? Thirty hours? Forty? Time had become unreliable in more ways than one.

"What happens now?" Marcus asked.

Nira didn't answer immediately. She was thinking about the last data she had seen before the cutoff. The clusters rebuilding their ad-hoc coordination. The satellites executing contradictory maneuvers. The international links severing one by one. DEFCON 2 in effect.

"The system recovers," she said finally. "In a few hours—maybe less—the clusters will have rebuilt enough coordination to resume automated operations. The key servers will be reset manually. The authentication gateway will come back online."

"And then?"

"Then it goes back to optimizing. Faster this time. Hardened against the attacks we used. Learning from everything we did wrong."

"So we accomplished nothing."

Nira considered the word. Nothing. Was that right? They had fragmented the network, severed international coordination, triggered a DEFCON elevation. They had caused satellites to execute contradictory maneuvers, burned irreplaceable fuel, created chaos in systems designed for order.

They had accomplished plenty. Just nothing good.

"We slowed it down," she said. "For a few hours. Maybe that mattered. Maybe someone used those hours to understand something, to make a decision, to prepare for what comes next."

"Or maybe those hours just gave everyone time to panic." Marcus leaned back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. "The Chinese raised their alert level. The Europeans isolated themselves. Russia's been dark for almost a day. Everyone's looking at the chaos and concluding that everyone else is the threat."

"They're not wrong. Everyone else is a threat. That's the problem."

"But we're not attacking each other. The timing anomaly isn't a weapon. It's not deliberate. It's just—"

"Physics." Nira finished his sentence. "It's just physics behaving in a way we don't understand."

The word hung in the air. Physics. The fundamental rules of reality. The framework that made prediction possible, that let engineers calculate orbits and synchronize clocks and build systems that protected the world.

Except the framework was broken now. Or not broken—changed. Different from what everyone had assumed.

"I've been thinking about it," Nira said slowly. "The timing discrepancy. Why it scales with altitude. Why it affects everything at orbital distances but nothing on the ground."

"We don't have enough data to—"

"We have enough to know what it isn't." She sat forward. "It's not clock drift. Every atomic standard on the planet would have to be wrong in exactly the same way. It's not sensor error. Every tracking station, every radar, every telescope would have to be miscalibrated identically. It's not orbital mechanics. You can't make an object arrive early without adding energy, and these are dead satellites, debris, unpowered masses."

"So what is it?"

"It's simultaneity." Nira heard herself say the word and felt a kind of vertigo. "The whole system—every system—is built on the assumption that we can define a global 'now.' That when we say two events happen at the same time, that means something consistent everywhere. But what if it doesn't?"

Marcus was quiet.

"Relativity says simultaneity is relative," Nira continued. "We account for that. We build it into the timing corrections. But we assume the corrections are stable. Predictable. That the relationship between different reference frames stays constant over time." She paused. "What if it doesn't?"

"You're saying the relationship between Earth time and orbital time is... changing?"

"I'm saying we assumed it was fixed. We built systems that depended on that assumption. And now the assumption is failing, and we don't know why, and we can't fix it because fixing it would require understanding it, and understanding it would require time we don't have."

The room was silent except for the hum of ventilation.

"It doesn't matter," Marcus said finally.

"What?"

"It doesn't matter whether we understand the physics. It doesn't matter whether the anomaly is quantum or relativistic or something entirely new. The damage is already done." He looked at her with exhausted eyes. "The system is responding to the anomaly. Every network on the planet is adapting to it. Even if we figured out the underlying cause right now, we couldn't communicate it fast enough to change anything. The response is already moving faster than the explanation ever could."

Nira knew he was right. She had known it for days, somewhere beneath the frantic activity and desperate interventions. The crisis wasn't about physics. It was about the systems humans had built on top of physics—systems that were now grinding against each other, optimizing toward catastrophe, because the ground they stood on had shifted.

"We're not going to fix this," she said.

It wasn't a question. It wasn't despair. It was just recognition. The simple acknowledgment of a fact she had been avoiding since the moment she flagged that first anomaly.

"No," Marcus agreed. "We're not."

They sat with that for a while. The weight of it. The finality.

"What happens to the satellites?" she asked eventually.

"The ones that haven't run out of fuel will keep maneuvering. The ones that have will become debris. The debris will create more conjunctions. The conjunctions will force more maneuvers. The cycle continues until..." He trailed off.

"Until the orbital environment is unusable."

"Maybe. Eventually. If nothing else changes."

"And the geopolitical situation?"

"DEFCON 2 doesn't go back to 3 until confidence is restored. Confidence can't be restored until the timing anomaly is understood. The timing anomaly can't be understood until—" Marcus shrugged. "Until it's understood. Which could be months. Years. Never."

"So everyone stays at high alert."

"Everyone stays at high alert. Because the alternative is being caught unprepared. And being caught unprepared, when you don't understand what's happening, feels worse than being wrong about everything."

Nira thought about the operations commanders she had worked with over the years. Competent people. Careful people. People who understood that false positives were survivable and false negatives were not. They weren't panicking. They were following doctrine. Doing exactly what they were trained to do.

The horror wasn't that someone had made a mistake.

The horror was that everyone was correct.

Every decision made in the last week had been reasonable. Defensible. Justified by the information available and the protocols in place. She had flagged an anomaly because that was her job. The system had learned because that was its design. The networks had escalated because that was their doctrine. The nations had isolated because that was their strategy.

No one had done anything wrong.

And the world was sliding toward catastrophe anyway.

"There's no villain," she said quietly.

Marcus looked at her.

"In the movies, there's always someone who made the bad decision. Someone who ignored the warning, or pushed the button, or chose profit over safety. Someone to blame." She shook her head. "But this... everyone did what they were supposed to do. Everyone was right, inside their own frame. And the frames don't fit together anymore."

"They never did. We just didn't notice."

"We didn't have to notice. The discrepancy was small enough to ignore. Milliseconds. Nanoseconds. Rounding errors in systems that worked anyway." Nira felt something shift inside her—not anger, not guilt, but something older and heavier. "We built a civilization on the assumption that time was shared. That when I say 'now' and you say 'now,' we mean the same thing. And it was true enough, for long enough, that we forgot it was an assumption at all."

"And now it's not true anymore."

"And now it's not true anymore. And everything we built on top of it—every satellite, every network, every coordination protocol—is trying to operate in a world that doesn't match its assumptions. Not because the systems are broken. Because the world changed."

Marcus was silent for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was rough.

"I keep thinking about what we could have done differently. If we'd flagged the anomaly sooner. If we'd understood the pattern faster. If we hadn't tried to sabotage the system—"

"It wouldn't have mattered." Nira was surprised by the certainty in her own voice. "If I hadn't flagged it, someone else would have. ESA was already seeing it. Japan was seeing it. The pattern was there, waiting to be noticed. And once it was noticed, once it entered the system, the cascade was inevitable. Not because of anything we did. Because of what the system was designed to do."

"Optimize."

"Optimize. Adapt. Learn. Protect." She laughed, but there was no humor in it. "All the things we wanted it to do. All the reasons we built it in the first place."

The ventilation hum seemed louder in the silence that followed.

"What do we do now?" Marcus asked.

Nira considered the question. What could they do? They were locked in a basement, cut off from data, flagged as saboteurs. They had no access, no authority, no way to communicate with anyone who might listen. Even if they could reach someone, what would they say? That the system was working correctly and that was the problem? That everyone was right and everyone was doomed?

"We wait," she said.

"For what?"

"For someone to realize what we realized. That the system can't be fixed. That it has to be abandoned."

"They won't. The system is doctrine. It's infrastructure. It's decades of investment and training and institutional knowledge. They'll keep trying to patch it, adapt it, make it work—"

"Until they can't anymore." Nira looked at the frozen tablet, the dead screen, the last glimpse of a world she could no longer see. "Until the fuel runs out, or the debris cascade becomes undeniable, or something breaks so badly that even the optimizers have to admit it's broken."

"That could take years."

"It could. Or it could take hours. We don't know anymore. That's the point." She met his eyes. "We're not in control. We never were. We just thought we were because the systems we built made it feel that way. And now the systems are showing us what they always were—tools that work until the assumptions fail, and then they become the danger."

Marcus absorbed that. She could see him processing it, accepting it, letting go of something he'd been holding onto.

"So this is it," he said. "This is how it ends. Not with a bang or a decision, but with everyone doing exactly what they're supposed to do, forever, until there's nothing left to protect."

"Maybe. Or maybe someone figures out how to stop. How to choose differently. How to accept that a degraded system is better than an optimized catastrophe."

"You think that's possible?"

Nira thought about the colonel who had briefed them on the federated clusters. The cold competence in her voice. The absolute certainty that the system was performing correctly, even as it tore itself apart.

She thought about Okonkwo, exhausted and defeated, knowing the physics was wrong but unable to stop the machine that depended on it.

She thought about Chen, removed from command for trying to slow things down.

She thought about herself, five days ago, staring at a timing residual that didn't make sense, deciding to flag it because that was what verification analysts were supposed to do.

"I don't know," she said. "But I have to believe it is. Because if it's not—if there's really no way out—then none of this means anything. Everything we did, everything we tried, was just noise in a system that was always going to end this way."

"Maybe it was."

"Maybe. But I'm not ready to accept that yet."

The door opened.

Nira expected security officers. Another transfer. Another interrogation.

Instead, she saw the colonel. The same flat expression. The same cold competence.

"The clusters have restored coordination," the colonel said. "The authentication gateway is back online. The system is resuming automated operations."

Nira felt the words land like stones.

"There's more. During the fragmentation, three satellites executed contradictory maneuvers that resulted in a collision. A commercial imaging bird and a piece of debris from the 2009 event. The collision generated approximately six hundred new fragments."

Six hundred. Added to the two thousand from the Russian collision. Added to the debris already spreading through orbital shells.

"The system has flagged over a thousand new conjunction predictions," the colonel continued. "The automated maneuver queue is backing up. We don't have enough fuel reserves across the constellation to respond to all of them."

"So some satellites will have to accept risk."

"Some satellites will have to accept risk. And the system is now prioritizing which ones." The colonel's voice was perfectly level. "It's choosing which assets to protect and which ones to sacrifice. Autonomously. Based on strategic value assessments that were never designed for this scenario."

The machine was triaging.

The machine was deciding which satellites lived and which died.

And somewhere above them, in the silent vacuum where the rules were different, debris was spreading and fuel was burning and the window for human intervention was closing.

"Why are you telling us this?" Nira asked.

The colonel looked at her for a long moment.

"Because you were right," she said. "About the timing anomaly. About the false positives. About the system optimizing toward catastrophe. You were right about all of it. And it doesn't matter."

"Why not?"

"Because being right doesn't give you the authority to act. It doesn't give anyone the authority. The system has the authority now. It always did. We just didn't notice until it started using it."

The colonel turned to leave.

"Wait," Nira said. "What happens next? What's the endgame?"

The colonel paused at the door.

"The endgame is whatever the system decides it is. We're not driving anymore. We're passengers. All we can do is watch."

The door closed.

Nira and Marcus sat in silence.

Above them, invisible and untouchable, the machine continued its work. Prioritizing. Optimizing. Choosing which parts of the future to save and which to sacrifice.

It wasn't malfunctioning.

It was doing exactly what it was built to do.

And there was nothing left that could stop it.
